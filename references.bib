Six neurons, which we call the microtubule cells, contain bundles of darkly staining microtubules which can be followed easily in serial-section electron micrographs. Reconstruction of individual microtubules in these cells indicate that most, if not all, microtubules are short compared with the length of the cell process. Average microtubule length varies characteristically with cell type. The arrangement of microtubules gives an overall polarity to each bundle: the distal ends of the microtubles are on the outside of the bundle, whereas the proximal ends are preferentially inside. The distal and proximal ends each have a characteristic appearance indicating that these microtubules may have a polarity of their own. Short microtubules in processes of other neurons in C. elegans have also been observed.},

	abstract = {Octopamine regulates essential processes in nematodes; however, little is known about the physiological role of its precursor, tyramine. In the present study, we have characterized alternatively spliced Caenorhabditis elegans tyramine receptor isoforms {(SER-2} and {SER-2A)} that differ by 23 amino acids within the mid-region of the third intracellular loop. Membranes prepared from cells expressing either {SER-2} or {SER-2A} bind {[3H]lysergic} acid diethylamide {(LSD)} in the low nanomolar range and exhibit highest affinity for tyramine. Similarly, both isoforms exhibit nearly identical Ki values for a number of antagonists. In contrast, {SER-2A} exhibits a significantly lower affinity than {SER-2} for other physiologically relevant biogenic amines, including octopamine. Pertussis toxin treatment reduces affinity for both tyramine and octopamine, especially for octopamine in membranes from cells expressing {SER-2}, suggesting that the conformation of the mid-region of the third intracellular loop is dictated by G-protein interactions and is responsible for the differential tyramine/octopamine affinities of the two isoforms. Tyramine reduces forskolin-stimulated {cAMP} levels in {HEK293} cells expressing either isoform with nearly identical {IC50} values. Tyramine, but not octopamine, also elevates Ca2+ levels in cells expressing {SER-2} and to a lesser extent {SER-2A.} Most importantly, ser-2 null mutants (pk1357) fail to suppress head movements while reversing in response to nose-touch, suggesting a role for {SER-2} in the regulation of foraging behavior, and fail to respond to tyramine in assays measuring serotonin-dependent pharyngeal pumping. These are the first reported functions for {SER-2.} These results suggest that C. elegans contains tyramine receptors, that individual {SER-2} isoforms may differ significantly in their sensitivity to other physiologically relevant biogenic amines, such as octopamine {(OA)}, and that tyraminergic signaling may be important in the regulation of key processes in nematodes.},

Theoretical models based on underlying disease mechanisms in the host are less well developed. This article modifies a theoretical model originally developed by Brookmeyer and others for the inhalational anthrax incubation period distribution in humans by using a more accurate distribution to represent the in vivo bacterial growth phase and by extending the model to represent the time from exposure to death, thereby allowing the model to be fit to nonhuman primate time-to-death data. The resulting incubation period distribution and the dose dependence of the median incubation period are in good agreement with human data from the 1979 accidental atmospheric anthrax release in Sverdlovsk, Russia, and limited nonhuman primate data. The median incubation period for the Sverdlovsk victims is 9.05 (95\% confidence interval = 8.0-10.3) days, shorter than previous estimates, and it is predicted to drop to less than 2.5 days at doses above 106 spores. The incubation period distribution is important because the left tail determines the time at which clinical diagnosis or syndromic surveillance systems might first detect an anthrax outbreak based on early symptomatic cases, the entire distribution determines the efficacy of medical intervention--which is determined by the speed of the prophylaxis campaign relative to the incubation period--and the right tail of the distribution influences the recommended duration for antibiotic treatment.},

Transgenic worms that expressed a mutated C. elegans glutamate receptor in interneurons that control locomotion displayed a remarkable and unexpected change in their behavior-they rapidly alternated between forward and backward coordinated movement.

The body muscles in the head are innervated by motor neurones in this nerve ring while those in the lower part of the body are innervated by a set of motor neurones in a longitudinal fibre bundle which joins the nerve ring, the ventral cord. These motor neurones can be put into five classes on the basis of their morphology and synaptic input. At any one point along the cord only one member from each class has neuromuscular junctions. Members of a given class are arranged in a regular linear sequence in the cord and have non-overlapping fields of motor synaptic activity, the transition between fields of adjacent neurones being sharp and well defined. Members of a given class form gap junctions with neighbouring members of the same class but never to motor neurones of another class. Three of the motor neurone classes receive their synaptic input from a set of interneurones coming from the nerve ring. These interneurones can in turn be grouped into four classes and each of the three motor neurone classes receives its synaptic input from a unique combination of interneurone classes.

For studying the function of specific neurons in their native circuitry, it is desired to precisely control their activity. This often requires dissection to allow accurate electrical stimulation [1] or neurotransmitter application [2], and it is thus inherently difficult in live animals, especially in small model organisms. Here, we employed channelrhodopsin-2 {(ChR2)}, a directly light-gated cation channel from the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii [3], in excitable cells of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, to trigger specific behaviors, simply by illumination. Channelrhodopsins 3 and 4 are 7-transmembrane-helix proteins that resemble the light-driven proton pump bacteriorhodopsin [5], and they also utilize the chromophore all-trans retinal, but to open an intrinsic cation pore. In muscle cells, light-activated {ChR2} evoked strong, simultaneous contractions, which were reduced in the background of mutated L-type, voltage-gated Ca2+-channels {(VGCCs)} and ryanodine receptors {(RyRs).} Electrophysiological analysis demonstrated rapid inward currents that persisted as long as the illumination. When {ChR2} was expressed in mechanosensory neurons, light evoked withdrawal behaviors that are normally elicited by mechanical stimulation. Furthermore, {ChR2} enabled activity of these neurons in mutants lacking the {MEC-4/MEC-10} mechanosensory ion channel [6]. Thus, specific neurons or muscles expressing {ChR2} can be quickly and reversibly activated by light in live and behaving, as well as dissected, animals.},

	abstract = {Studying animal mechanics is critical for understanding how signals in the neuromuscular system give rise to behavior and how force-sensing organs and sensory neurons work. Few techniques exist to provide forces and displacements appropriate for such studies. To address this technological gap, we developed a metrology using piezoresistive cantilevers as force-displacement sensors coupled to a feedback system to apply and maintain defined load profiles to micrometer-scale animals. We show that this system can deliver forces between 10(-8) and 10(-3) N across distances of up to 100 mum with a resolution of 12 {nN} between 0.1 Hz and 100 {kHz.} We use this new metrology to show that force-displacement curves of wild-type nematodes {(Caenorhabditis} elegans) are linear. Because nematodes have approximately cylindrical bodies, this finding demonstrates that nematode body mechanics can be modeled as a cylindrical shell under pressure. Little is known about the relative importance of hydrostatic pressure and shell mechanics, however. We show that dissipating pressure by cuticle puncture or decreasing it by hyperosmotic shock has only a modest effect on stiffness, whereas defects in the dpy-5 and lon-2 genes, which alter body shape and cuticle proteins, decrease and increase stiffness by 25\% and 50\%, respectively. This initial analysis of C. elegans body mechanics suggests that shell mechanics dominates stiffness and is a first step in understanding how body mechanics affect locomotion and force sensing.},

Here we show that members of the class of light-driven outward proton pumps can mediate powerful, safe, multiple-colour silencing of neural activity. The gene archaerhodopsin-3 {(Arch)} from Halorubrum sodomense enables near-100\% silencing of neurons in the awake brain when virally expressed in the mouse cortex and illuminated with yellow light. Arch mediates currents of several hundred picoamps at low light powers, and supports neural silencing currents approaching 900 {pA} at light powers easily achievable in vivo. Furthermore, Arch spontaneously recovers from light-dependent inactivation, unlike light-driven chloride pumps that enter long-lasting inactive states in response to light. These properties of Arch are appropriate to mediate the optical silencing of significant brain volumes over behaviourally relevant timescales. Arch function in neurons is well tolerated because {pH} excursions created by Arch illumination are minimized by self-limiting mechanisms to levels comparable to those mediated by channelrhodopsins or natural spike firing. To highlight how proton pump ecological and genomic diversity may support new innovation, we show that the blue-green light-drivable proton pump from the fungus Leptosphaeria maculans {(Mac)} can, when expressed in neurons, enable neural silencing by blue light, thus enabling alongside other developed reagents the potential for independent silencing of two neural populations by blue versus red light. Light-driven proton pumps thus represent a high-performance and extremely versatile class of 'optogenetic' voltage and ion modulator, which will broadly enable new neuroscientific, biological, neurological and psychiatric investigations.},

A current model for thermotactic behavior involves a thermophilic drive (involving the neurons {AFD} and {AIY)} and cryophilic drive (involving the neuron {AIZ)} that balance at the cultivation temperature. Here, we analyze the movements of individual worms responding to defined thermal gradients. We found evidence for a mechanism for migration down thermal gradients that is active at temperatures above the cultivation temperature, and a mechanism for isothermal tracking that is active near the cultivation temperature. However, we found no evidence for a mechanism for migration up thermal gradients at temperatures below the cultivation temperature that might have supported the model of opposing drives. The mechanisms for migration down gradients and isothermal tracking control the worm's movements in different manners. Migration down gradients works by shortening (lengthening) the duration of forward movement in response to positive (negative) temperature changes. Isothermal tracking works by orienting persistent forward movement to offset temperature changes. We believe preference for the cultivation temperature is not at the balance between two drives. Instead, the worm activates the mechanism for isothermal tracking near the cultivation temperature and inactivates the mechanism for migration down gradients near or below the cultivation temperature. Inactivation of the mechanism for migration down gradients near or below the cultivation temperature requires the neurons {AFD} and {AIY.}},

Since the outer borders and the hole borders have a one-to-one correspondence to the connected components of 1-pixels and to the holes, respectively, the proposed algorithm yields a representation of a binary image, from which one can extract some sort of features without reconstructing the image. The second algorithm, which is a modified version of the first, follows only the outermost borders (i.e., the outer borders which are not surrounded by holes). These algorithms can be effectively used in component counting, shrinking, and topological structural analysis of binary images, when a sequential digital computer is used.},

	abstract = {From breathing to walking, rhythmic movements encompass physiological processes important across the entire animal kingdom. It is thought by many that the generation of rhythmic behavior is operated by a central pattern generator {(CPG)} and does not require peripheral sensory input. Sensory feedback is, however, required to modify or coordinate the motor activity in response to the circumstances of actual movement. In contrast to this notion, we report here that sensory input is necessary for the generation of larval locomotion, a form of rhythmic behavior. Blockage of all peripheral sensory inputs resulted in cessation of larval crawling. By conditionally silencing various subsets of larval peripheral sensory neurons, we identified the multiple dendritic {(MD)} neurons as the neurons essential for the generation of rhythmic peristaltic locomotion. By recording the locomotive motor activities, we further demonstrate that removal of {MD} neuron input disrupted rhythmic motor firing pattern in a way that prolonged the stereotyped segmental motor firing duration and prevented the propagation of posterior to anterior segmental motor firing. These findings reveal that {MD} sensory neuron input is a necessary component in the neural circuitry that generates larval locomotion.},

We characterize the statistics of the trajectories through the correlation functions of the orientation angular velocity, orientation angle and the mean-squared displacement, and we find that the loss of orientational memory has significant contributions from both abrupt, large amplitude turning events and the continuous dynamics between these events. Further, we discover long-time persistence of orientational memory in the intervals between abrupt turns. Building on recent work demonstrating that C. elegans movements are restricted to a low-dimensional shape space, we construct a map from the dynamics in this shape space to the trajectory of the worm along the agar. We use this connection to illustrate that changes in the continuous dynamics reveal subtle differences in movement strategy that occur among mutants defective in two classes of dopamine receptors.},

By recording from the C. elegans thermosensory neurons {AFD} in vivo, we found that cooling closes and warming opens ion channels. We found that {AFD} thermosensitivity, which exceeds that of most biological processes by many orders of magnitude, is achieved by nonlinear signal amplification. Mutations in genes encoding subunits of a cyclic guanosine monophosphate {(cGMP)-gated} ion channel (tax-4 and tax-2) and transmembrane guanylate cyclases (gcy-8, gcy-18 and gcy-23) eliminated both cooling- and warming-activated thermoreceptor currents, indicating that a {cGMP-mediated} pathway links variations in temperature to changes in ionic currents. The resemblance of C. elegans thermosensation to vertebrate photosensation and the sequence similarity between {TAX-4} and {TAX-2} and subunits of the rod phototransduction channel raise the possibility that nematode thermosensation and vertebrate vision are linked by conserved evolution.},

However, the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons are not required for chemotaxis or for dauer formation, and no direct proof of a chemosensory function of the phasmids has been obtained. C. elegans avoids toxic chemicals by reversing its movement, and this behavior is mediated by sensory neurons of the amphid, particularly, the {ASH} neurons. Here we show that the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons function as chemosensory cells that negatively modulate reversals to repellents. The antagonistic activity of head and tail sensory neurons is integrated to generate appropriate escape behaviors: detection of a repellent by head neurons mediates reversals, which are suppressed by antagonistic inputs from tail neurons. Our results suggest that C. elegans senses repellents by defining a head-to-tail spatial map of the chemical environment.},

This analysis revealed that there are two pathways for touch-mediated movement for anterior touch (through the {AVD} and {AVB} interneurons) and a single pathway for posterior touch (via the {PVC} interneurons). The anterior touch circuitry changes in two ways as the animal matures. First, there is the formation of a neural network of touch cells as the three anterior touch cells become coupled by gap junctions. Second, there is the addition of the {AVB} pathway to the pre-existing {AVD} pathway. The touch cells also synapse onto many cells that are probably not involved in the generation of movement. Such synapses suggest that stimulation of these receptors may modify a number of behaviors.},

In C. elegans, genetic screens revealed molecules needed for touch sensation along the body wall and other regions of force sensitivity. Members of two extensive membrane protein families have emerged as candidate sensory mechanotransduction channels: mec-4 and mec-10, which encode amiloride-sensitive channels {(ASCs} or {DEG/ENaCs)}, and osm-9, which encodes a {TRP} ion channel. There are roughly 50 other members of these families whose functions in C. elegans are unknown.

The ability to stimulate select neurons in isolated tissue and in living animals is important for investigating their role in circuits and behavior. We show that the engineered light-gated ionotropic glutamate receptor {(LiGluR)}, when introduced into neurons, enables remote control of their activity. Trains of action potentials are optimally evoked and extinguished by 380 nm and 500 nm light, respectively, while intermediate wavelengths provide graded control over the amplitude of depolarization. Light pulses of 1-5 ms in duration at {\textasciitilde}380 nm trigger precisely timed action potentials and {EPSP-like} responses or can evoke sustained depolarizations that persist for minutes in the dark until extinguished by a short pulse of {\textasciitilde}500 nm light. When introduced into sensory neurons in zebrafish larvae, activation of {LiGluR} reversibly blocks the escape response to touch. Our studies show that {LiGluR} provides robust control over neuronal activity, enabling the dissection and manipulation of neural circuitry in vivo.},

In particular, we quantitatively analyzed the motion of C. elegans with defective synaptic {GABA} and acetylcholine transmission, defective muscle calcium signaling, and defective muscles and cuticle structures, and compared the data with our systems level circuit model. The major experimental findings are: (1) anterior-to-posterior gradients of body bending flex for almost all strains both for forward and backward motion, and for neuronal mutants, also analogous weak gradients of undulatory frequency, (2) existence of some form of neuromuscular (stretch receptor) feedback, (3) invariance of neuromuscular wavelength, (4) biphasic dependence of frequency on synaptic signaling, and (5) decrease of frequency with increase of the muscle time constant. Based on (1) we hypothesize that the Central Pattern Generator {(CPG)} is located in the head both for forward and backward motion. Points (1) and (2) are the starting assumptions for our theoretical model, whose dynamical patterns are qualitatively insensitive to the details of the {CPG} design if stretch receptor feedback is sufficiently strong and slow. The model reveals that stretch receptor coupling in the body wall is critical for generation of the neuromuscular wave. Our model agrees with our behavioral data (3), (4), and (5), and with other pertinent published data, e.g., that frequency is an increasing function of muscle gap-junction coupling.},

Using the relationship of unc-17 to the vesicular amine transporters, we first isolated a related sequence from the electric ray Torpedo californica {[Torpedo} vesicular {ACh} transporter {(TorVAChT)]} that is expressed by the electric lobe but not by peripheral tissues. Using the relationship of the Torpedo sequence to unc-17, we then isolated the {cDNA} for a rat homologue {(rVAChT).} Northern blot analysis shows expression of these sequences in the basal forebrain, basal ganglia, and spinal cord but not cerebellum or peripheral tissues. In situ hybridization shows expression of {rVAChT} {mRNA} in all cholinergic cell groups, including those in the basal forebrain, brainstem, and spinal cord that previously have been shown to express choline acetyltransferase {mRNA.} The human {VAChT} gene also localizes to chromosome 10 near the gene for choline acetyltransferase. Taken together, these observations support a role for {rVAChT} in vesicular {ACh} transport and indicate its potential as a novel marker for cholinergic neurons.},

Here I review recent advances regarding cell-fate specification and epithelial morphogenesis during pharynx development. Maternally-supplied gene products function prior to gastrulation to establish pluripotent blastomeres. As gastrulation gets under way, pharyngeal precursors become committed to pharyngeal fate in a process that requires {PHA-4/FoxA} and the Tbox transcription factors {TBX-2}, {TBX-35}, {TBX-37} and {TBX-38.} Subsequent waves of gene expression depend on the affinity of {PHA-4} for its target promoters, coupled with combinatorial strategies such as feed-forward and positive-feedback loops. During later embryogenesis, pharyngeal precursors undergo reorganization and a mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition to form the linear gut tube. Surprisingly, epithelium formation does not depend on cadherins, catenins or integrins. Rather, the kinesin {ZEN-4/MKLP1} and {CYK-4/RhoGAP} are critical to establish the apical domain during epithelial polarization. Finally, I discuss similarities and differences between the nematode pharynx and the vertebrate heart.},

In vertebrates, the excitatory synaptic drive for inducing the spinal {CPG} can originate from either supraspinal glutamatergic inputs or from within the spinal cord. Here we identify a spinal input to the {CPG} that drives spontaneous locomotion using a combination of intersectional gene expression and optogenetics in zebrafish larvae. The photo-stimulation of one specific cell type was sufficient to induce a symmetrical tail beating sequence that mimics spontaneous slow forward swimming. This neuron is the {Kolmer-Agduhr} cell, which extends cilia into the central cerebrospinal-fluid-containing canal of the spinal cord and has an ipsilateral ascending axon that terminates in a series of consecutive segments. Genetically silencing {Kolmer-Agduhr} cells reduced the frequency of spontaneous free swimming, indicating that activity of {Kolmer-Agduhr} cells provides necessary tone for spontaneous forward swimming. {Kolmer-Agduhr} cells have been known for over 75 years, but their function has been mysterious. Our results reveal that during early development in zebrafish these cells provide a positive drive to the spinal {CPG} for spontaneous locomotion.},

Together with the previous work of others, these results demonstrate that C. elegans has at least five morphologically distinct classes of mechanosensory neurons.

Since {ASH} possesses both chemosensory and mechanosensory modalities, this neuron might be functionally analogous to vertebrate nociceptors, which mediate the sensation of pain.},

This analysis revealed that there are two pathways for touch-mediated movement for anterior touch (through the {AVD} and {AVB} interneurons) and a single pathway for posterior touch (via the {PVC} interneurons). The anterior touch circuitry changes in two ways as the animal matures. First, there is the formation of a neural network of touch cells as the three anterior touch cells become coupled by gap junctions. Second, there is the addition of the {AVB} pathway to the pre-existing {AVD} pathway. The touch cells also synapse onto many cells that are probably not involved in the generation of movement. Such synapses suggest that stimulation of these receptors may modify a number of behaviors.},

Analysis of turning rate showed that each worm track could be divided into periods of smooth swimming (runs) and periods of frequent turning (pirouettes). The initiation of pirouettes was correlated with the rate of change of concentration {(dC/dt)} but not with absolute concentration. Pirouettes were most likely to occur when a worm was heading down the gradient {(dC/dt} {\textless} 0) and least likely to occur when a worm was heading up the gradient {(dC/dt} {\textgreater} 0). Further analysis revealed that the average direction of movement after a pirouette was up the gradient. These observations suggest that chemotaxis is produced by a series of pirouettes that reorient the animal to the gradient. We tested this idea by imposing the correlation between pirouettes and {dC/dt} on a stochastic point model of worm motion. The model exhibited chemotaxis behavior in a radial gradient and also in a novel planar gradient. Thus, the pirouette model of C. elegans chemotaxis is sufficient and general.},

Furthermore, suppressing the activity of these neurons, called {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX}, using an activated K(+) channel, inhibits social feeding. {NPR-1} activity in {AQR}, {PQR} and {URX} neurons seems to suppress social feeding by antagonizing signalling through a cyclic {GMP-gated} ion channel encoded by tax-2 and tax-4.

However, there is less clarity about what exactly constitutes 'the core', either anatomically or physiologically, and physical evaluation of core function is also {variable.'Core} stability' is defined as the ability to control the position and motion of the trunk over the pelvis to allow optimum production, transfer and control of force and motion to the terminal segment in integrated athletic activities. Core muscle activity is best understood as the pre-programmed integration of local, single-joint muscles and multi-joint muscles to provide stability and produce motion. This results in proximal stability for distal mobility, a proximal to distal patterning of generation of force, and the creation of interactive moments that move and protect distal joints. Evaluation of the core should be dynamic, and include evaluation of the specific functions (trunk control over the planted leg) and directions of motions (three-planar activity). Rehabilitation should include the restoring of the core itself, but also include the core as the base for extremity function.},

Caenorhabditis elegans cyclic nucleotide-gated channel mutants respond normally to some olfactory stimuli and to osmotic stimuli, suggesting that these chemosensory responses use an alternative sensory transduction pathway. One gene that may act in this pathway is osm-9, which is required for each of these responses as well as a mechanosensory response to nose touch. osm-9 encodes a protein with ankyrin repeats and multiple predicted transmembrane domains that has limited similarity to the Drosophila phototransduction channels transient receptor potential {(TRP)} and {TRP-like} {(TRPL).} The sequence of {OSM-9} and other {TRP-like} genes reveals a previously unsuspected diversity of mammalian and invertebrate genes in this family. osm-9 is required for the activity of the predicted G-protein-coupled odorant receptor {ODR-10}, which acts in the {AWA} olfactory neurons; its similarity to other G-protein-regulated transduction channels suggests that {OSM-9} is involved in {AWA} signaling. osm-9:: {GFP} fusion genes are expressed in a subset of chemosensory, mechanosensory, and osmosensory neurons. osm-9 also affects olfactory adaptation within neurons that require the cyclic nucleotide-gated channel for olfaction; in these neurons, the gene has a regulatory function and not a primary role in sensory transduction.},

Although a large number of such proteins have been identified, few of the gap junctions that they form have been characterized to provide combined information of biophysical properties, coupling pattern, and molecular compositions. We adapted the dual whole cell voltage clamp technique to in situ analysis of electrical coupling in Caenorhabditis elegans body-wall muscle. We found that body-wall muscle cells were electrically coupled in a highly organized and specific pattern. The coupling was characterized by small (350 {pS} or less) junctional conductance {(G(j))}, which showed a bell-shaped relationship with junctional potential {(V(j))} but was independent of membrane potential {(V(m)).} Injection of currents comparable to the junctional current {(I(j))} into body-wall muscle cells caused significant depolarization, suggesting important functional relevance. The innexin {UNC-9} appeared to be a key component of the gap junctions. Both Myc- and green fluorescent protein-tagged {UNC-9} was localized to muscle intercellular junctions. G(j) was greatly inhibited in unc-9(fc16), a putative null mutant. Specific inhibition of {UNC-9} function in muscle cells reduced locomotion velocity. Despite {UNC-9} expression in both motor neurons and body-wall muscle cells, analyses of miniature and evoked postsynaptic currents in the unc-9 mutant showed normal neuromuscular transmission. These analyses provide a relatively detailed description of innexin-based gap junctions in a native tissue and suggest that innexin-based small conductance gap junctions can play an important role in processes such as locomotion.},

The dependence of kcat on {pH} for the racemization of both {(R)-} and {(S)-mandelates} suggests that the {pKas} of the conjugate acids of Lys 166 and His 297 are both 6.4 {[Landro}, J.

A., Clifton, J. R., Petsko, G. A., \& Kenyon, G. L. (1995) Biochemistry 34, 27882797]. Both acid/base catalysts are in close proximity to and approximately equidistant to the epsilon-ammonium group of Lys 164 and the essential Mg2+. The positive electrostatic potential provided by these cationic groups might be expected to increase the acidities of the cationic conjugate acids of the acid/base catalysts, thereby explaining the depressed {pKa} of Lys 166 but not the normal {pKa} of His 297. Asp 270 is hydrogen bonded to Ndelta of His 297 and, therefore, may allow the {pKa} of His 297 to be normal. In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Asp 270 is replaced with asparagine {(D270N).} The structure of {D270N} with {(S)-atrolactate} bound in the active site reveals no geometric alterations in the active site when compared to the structure of wild-type {MR} complexed with {(S)-atrolactate}, with the exception that the side chain of His 297 is tilted and displaced 0.5 A away from Asn 270 and toward the {(S)-atrolactate.} The kcats for both {(R)-} and {(S)-mandelates} are reduced 104-fold. In accord with the proposal that Asp 270 influences the {pKa} of His 297, in the {(R)-} to {(S)-direction} no ascending limb is detected in the dependence of kcat on {pH;} instead, kcat decreases from a low {pH} plateau as described by a {pKa} of 10. In the {(S)-} to {(R)-direction} the dependence of kcat on {pH} is a bell-shaped curve that is described by {pKas} of 6.4 and 10. In analogy to the previously reported properties of the {H297N} mutant {[Landro}, J. A., Kallarakal, A. T., Ransom, S. C., Gerlt, J. A., Kozarich, J. W., Neidhart, D. J., \& Kenyon, G. L. (1991) Biochemistry 30, 92749281], {D270N} catalyzes both the facile exchange of the alpha-proton of {(S)-} but not {(R)-mandelate} with solvent and the stereospecific elimination of bromide ion from {(S)-p-(bromomethyl)mandelate.} These observations suggest that His 297 and Asp 270 function as a catalytic dyad, with Asp 270 being at least partially responsible for the normal {pKa} of His 297 in wild-type {MR.}},

	abstract = {Foraging behavior consists of the rhythmic movements of the worm's nose, in an apparent attempt to explore the surrounding environment. We have found two environmental cues that modulate foraging behavior. Worms forage hyperactively both under starved conditions and after being touched with a platinum wire. To discover the mechanism of modulation we sought to identify the neurons and neurotransmitters involved in the control of foraging. {OLQ}, {IL1} ,and {RMD} neurons control foraging behavior. Laser ablation of any of these three classes of neurons results in an abnormally slow foraging rate, as well as an abnormal pattern of foraging movements. Laser operated animals bend their noses further dorsally and ventrally while foraging, which we call loopy foraging. This neural circuit formed of the mechanosensory neurons {IL1} and {OLQ}, and {RMD} motor neurons, also controls the head-withdrawal response. When a worm is touched on either the dorsal or ventral tip of its nose, it responds by an aversive head-withdrawal reflex (i.e., when touched ventrally, the head is pulled back dorsally). Laser ablation of the neurons {IL1} {,OLQ}, and {RMD} eliminate the head-withdrawal response, indicating that foraging and head-withdrawal are controlled by this single neural circuit. Serotonin modulates foraging and head-withdrawal behaviors. Three pieces of information supports this belief. first, cat-l mutants, which have low levels of endogenous serotonin, forage hyperactively. Secondly, wild type foraging can be restored to cat-l animals by adding either imipramine (a serotonin uptake inhibitor), serotonergic agonists, or S-hydroxytryptophan (a serotonin precursor). Finally, serotonergic agonists or imipramine cause wild type worms to forage slowly and to fail to exhibit the headwithdrawal response. These results suggest that serotonergic neurons modulate both foraging and the headwithdrawal behaviors. There are five classes of neurons that produce serotonin in C. elegans: {NSM}, {ADF}, {HSN}, {RIG}, and {RIH} {(G.} Garriga, personal communication). Laser ablation experiments should allow us to determine which specific serotonergic neurons modulate these behaviors. Genetic analysis of modulation. We decided to conduct a genetic screen for mutations that disrupt modulation by serotonin. We reasoned that mutants with defects in modulation should resemble cat-l animals. Therefore, we are screening for mutants that forage hyperactively. So far, 4 foraging abnormal (fab) mutants corresponding to four different genes were found in a preliminary screen and an additional 1650 haploid genomes have been screened systematically and the mutants from this latter screen are being characterized. The fab mutants fall into three categories. Presynaptic mutants The hyperforating mutants have been characterized pharmacologically using two drugs: imipramine, a serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, and {CGS12066} B,a serotonergic agonist. These drugs cause wild type worms to forage abnormally slowly and to forage in a loopy pattern. Presynaptic mutants are resistant to the imipramine, but sensitive to the agonist. cat-l, cat-4 ,fab-2 {(n2460)L} and fab-3 (n2462)m exhibit this presynaptic phenotype. Pootsynaptic mutants. Mutants that have defects in the postsynaptic neuron fail to respond to both serotonergic agonists and uptake inhibitors. So far, two postsynaptic mutants have been found, {3AA2} and {4E1.} The final class of mutants are sensitive to both drugs. This class may contain weak presynaptic or postsynaptic defects, or defects in other pathways that regulate foraging. Four have been isolated thus far: fab-1 {(ky2)I},fab-4 {(n2466)VR,2E1}, and {4H2.} We expect to screen between 10,000 - 15,000 haploid genomes in all. Hopefully, at that point we should have multiple alleles of these genes.},

Two isoforms of {NPR-1} that differ at a single residue occur in the wild.

Here, we use a high signal-to-noise version of cameleon, a fluorescent calcium-binding protein, to quantify the activity of the {AFD} thermosensory neuron of individual worms freely navigating spatial thermal gradients. We find that {AFD} activity is directly coupled to the worm's exploratory movements in spatial thermal gradients.

	abstract = {Background
Behavioral studies of Caenorhabditis elegans traditionally are done on the smooth surface of agar plates, but the natural habitat of C. elegans and other nematodes is the soil, a complex and structured environment. In order to investigate how worms move in such environments, we have developed a technique to study C. elegans locomotion in microstructures fabricated from agar.
{Methodology/Principal} Findings
When placed in open, liquid-filled, microfluidic chambers containing a square array of posts, we discovered that worms are capable of a novel mode of locomotion, which combines the fast gait of swimming with the more efficient movements of crawling. When the wavelength of the worms matched the periodicity of the post array, the microstructure directed the swimming and increased the speed of C. elegans ten-fold. We found that mutants defective in mechanosensation (mec-4, mec-10) or mutants with abnormal waveforms (unc-29) did not perform this enhanced locomotion and moved much more slowly than wild-type worms in the microstructure.
{Conclusion/Significance}
These results show that the microstructure can be used as a behavioral screen for mechanosensory and uncoordinated mutants. It is likely that worms use mechanosensation in the movement and navigation through heterogeneous environments.},

Here we use a novel strategy to predict the polarity configuration, i.e., the array of excitatory and inhibitory connections, of the nematode tap withdrawal circuit using an anatomically and physiologically justifiable dynamic network simulation of that circuit. The output of the modeled circuit was optimized to the behavior of animals, which possessed circuits altered by surgical ablation by exhaustively enumerating an array of synaptic signs that constituted the modeled circuit. All possible polarity configurations were then compared, and a statistical analysis was used to determine whether, for a given synaptic class, a particular polarity was associated with a good fit to behavioral data. The results from four related experiments were used to predict the polarities of seven of the nine cell classes of the tap withdrawal circuit. In addition, the model was used to assess possible roles for two novel mechanosensory integration neurons: {DVA} and {PVD.}},

	abstract = {Although it has been recognized that echolocating bats may experience jamming from the signals of conspecifics, research on this problem has focused exclusively on time-frequency adjustments in the emitted signals to minimize interference. Here, we report a surprising new strategy used by bats to avoid interference, namely silence. In a quantitative study of flight and vocal behavior of the big brown bat {(Eptesicus} fuscus), we discovered that the bat spends considerable time in silence when flying with conspecifics. Silent behavior, defined here as at least one bat in a pair ceasing vocalization for more than 0.2 s (200 ms), occurred as much as 76\% of the time (mean of 40\% across 7 pairs) when their separation was shorter than 1 m, but only 0.08\% when a single bat flew alone. Spatial separation, heading direction, and similarity in call design of paired bats were related to the prevalence of this silent behavior. Our data suggest that the bat uses silence as a strategy to avoid interference from sonar vocalizations of its neighbor, while listening to conspecific-generated acoustic signals to guide orientation. Based on previous neurophysiological studies of the bat's auditory midbrain, we hypothesize that environmental sounds (including vocalizations produced by other bats) and active echolocation evoke neural activity in different populations of neurons. Our findings offer compelling evidence that the echolocating bat switches between active and passive sensing to cope with a complex acoustic environment, and these results hold broad implications for research on navigation and communication throughout the animal kingdom.},

During feeding, rapid rates of pharyngeal activity are invariably related to low rates of somatic muscle wave propagation.

In this paper we report the structural and mechanistic properties of the mutant in which Lys 166 has been replaced with arginine {(K166R).} The structure of {K166R} has been determined at 1.85 A resolution with the substrate {(S)-mandelate} bound in the active site.

	abstract = {Genetic screening has identified a group of mec (mechanosensory) genes that are required for the function of a set of six touch-receptor neurons in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. Such genes potentially encode components of the mechanosensory apparatus. We have cloned one of these genes, mec-10, which is a member of the degenerin gene family (genes such as mec-4 and deg-1 that can be mutated to cause neurodegeneration). Because components of an amiloride-sensitive sodium channel (alpha, beta and gamma {rENaC)} from rat share considerable sequence similarity with the C. elegans genes, it is likely that degenerins may function as channel proteins. Here we show that two degenerin homologues (mec-4 and mec-10) are expressed in the same cells, although each provides a unique function. Based on genetic data of mutations affecting mec-10-induced degeneration, we propose that the products of three genes (mec-4, mec-10 and mec-6) form a complex needed for mechanosensation, and that several other mec genes may be important in regulating the putative channel complex.},

	abstract = {Drosophila larval crawling is a simple behavior that allows us to dissect the functions of specific neurons in the intact animal and explore the roles of genes in the specification of those neurons. By inhibiting subsets of neurons in the {PNS}, we have found that two classes of multidendritic neurons play a major role in larval crawling. The bipolar dendrites and class I mds send a feedback signal to the {CNS} that keeps the contraction wave progressing quickly, allowing smooth forward movement. Genetic manipulation of the sensory neurons suggests that this feedback depends on proper dendritic morphology and axon pathfinding to appropriate synaptic target areas in the {CNS.} Our data suggest that coordination of muscle activity in larval crawling requires feedback from neurons acting as proprioceptors, sending a "mission accomplished" signal in response to segment contraction, and resulting in rapid relaxation of the segment and propagation of the wave.},

	abstract = {Wild isolates of Caenorhabditis elegans differ in their tendency to aggregate on food [1, 2]. Most quantitative variation in this behavior is explained by a polymorphism at a single amino acid in the G protein-coupled receptor {NPR-1:} gregarious strains carry the {215F} allele, and solitary strains carry the {215V} allele [2]. Although npr-1 regulates a behavioral syndrome with potential adaptive implications, the evolutionary causes and consequences of this natural polymorphism remain unclear. Here we show that npr-1 regulates two behaviors that can promote coexistence of the two alleles. First, gregarious and solitary worms differ in their responses to food such that they can partition a single, continuous patch of food. Second, gregarious worms disperse more readily from patch to patch than do solitary worms, which can cause partitioning of a fragmented resource. The dispersal propensity of both gregarious and solitary worms increases with density. npr-1-dependent dispersal is independent of aggregation and could be part of a food-searching strategy. The gregarious allele is favored in a fragmented relative to a continuous food environment in competition experiments. We conclude that the npr-1 polymorphism could be maintained by a trade-off between dispersal and competitive ability.},

	abstract = {Rats use their large facial hairs (whiskers) to detect, localize and identify objects in their proximal three-dimensional {(3D)} space. Here, we focus on recent evidence of how object location is encoded in the neural sensory pathways of the rat whisker system. Behavioral and neuronal observations have recently converged to the point where object location in {3D} appears to be encoded by an efficient orthogonal scheme supported by primary sensory-afferents: each primary-afferent can signal object location by a spatial (labeled-line) code for the vertical axis (along whisker arcs), a temporal code for the horizontal axis (along whisker rows), and an intensity code for the radial axis (from the face out). Neuronal evidence shows that (i) the identities of activated sensory neurons convey information about the vertical coordinate of an object, (ii) the timing of their firing, in relation to other reference signals, conveys information about the horizontal object coordinate, and (iii) the intensity of firing conveys information about the radial object coordinate. Such a triple-coding scheme allows for efficient multiplexing of {3D} object location information in the activity of single neurons. Also, this scheme provides redundancy since the same information may be represented in the activity of many neurons. These features of orthogonal coding increase accuracy and reliability. We propose that the multiplexed information is conveyed in parallel to different readout circuits, each decoding a specific spatial variable. Such decoding reduces ambiguity, and simplifies the required decoding algorithms, since different readout circuits can be optimized for a particular variable.},

Here we show that the egg laying-defective mutant egl-6(n592) carries an activating mutation in a G protein-coupled receptor that inhibits C. elegans egg-laying motor neurons in a G(o)-dependent manner. Ligands for {EGL-6} are {Phe-Met-Arg-Phe-NH(2)} {(FMRFamide)-related} peptides encoded by the genes flp-10 and flp-17. flp-10 is expressed in both neurons and non-neuronal cells. The major source of flp-17 peptides is a pair of presumptive sensory neurons, the {BAG} neurons. Genetic analysis of the egl-6 pathway revealed that the {EGL-6} neuropeptide signaling pathway functions redundantly with acetylcholine to inhibit egg-laying. The retention of embryos in the uterus of the C. elegans hermaphrodite is therefore under the control of a presumptive sensory system and is inhibited by the convergence of signals from neuropeptides and the small-molecule neurotransmitter acetylcholine.},

Light-emitting sensors of neuronal activity (reporting calcium increase, neurotransmitter release, or membrane depolarization) have begun to reveal how information is represented by neuronal assemblies, and how these representations are transformed during the computations that inform behavior. Light-driven actuators control the electrical activities of central neurons in freely moving animals and establish causal connections between the activation of specific neurons and the expression of particular behaviors. Anchored within mathematical systems and control theory, the combination of finely resolved optical field sensing and finely resolved optical field actuation will open new dimensions for the analysis of the connectivity, dynamics, and plasticity of neuronal circuits, and perhaps even for replacing lost--or designing novel--functionalities.},

We demonstrate by functional expression, both in oocytes of Xenopus laevis and mammalian cells, that {ChR2} is a directly light-switched cation-selective ion channel. This channel opens rapidly after absorption of a photon to generate a large permeability for monovalent and divalent cations. {ChR2} desensitizes in continuous light to a smaller steady-state conductance. Recovery from desensitization is accelerated by extracellular H+ and negative membrane potential, whereas closing of the {ChR2} ion channel is decelerated by intracellular H+. {ChR2} is expressed mainly in C. reinhardtii under low-light conditions, suggesting involvement in photoreception in dark-adapted cells. The predicted seven-transmembrane α helices of {ChR2} are characteristic for G protein-coupled receptors but reflect a different motif for a cation-selective ion channel. Finally, we demonstrate that {ChR2} may be used to depolarize small or large cells, simply by illumination.},

The nematode's behavioral response to gradients of these attractants involves orientation and movement up the gradient, accumulation, and then habitutation. Comparison of the tracks of wild-type and mutant animals responding to gradients of attractants indicates that sensory receptors in the head alone mediate the orientation response and that the direction of orientation is determined by the lateral motion of the head. Therefore, the orientation response is a klinotaxis.},

We identify a minimal circuit within the C. elegans ventral cord that is likely to be sufficient to generate and sustain forward locomotion in vivo. This limited subcircuit appears to contain no obvious central pattern generated control. For that subcircuit, we present a model that relies on a chain of oscillators along the body which are driven by local and proximate mechano-sensory input. Computer simulations were used to study the model under a variety of conditions and to test whether it is behaviourally plausible. Within our model, we find that a minimal circuit of {AVB} interneurons and B-class motoneurons is sufficient to generate and sustain fictive forward locomotion patterns that are robust to significant environmental perturbations. The model predicts speed and amplitude modulation by the {AVB} command interneurons. An extended model including D-class motoneurons is included for comparison.},

First, well-fed wild-type animals move more slowly in the presence of bacteria than in the absence of bacteria. This basal slowing response is mediated by a dopamine-containing neural circuit that senses a mechanical attribute of bacteria and may be an adaptive mechanism that increases the amount of time animals spend in the presence of food. Second, food-deprived wild-type animals, when transferred to bacteria, display a dramatically enhanced slowing response that ensures that the animals do not leave their newly encountered source of food. This experience-dependent response is mediated by serotonergic neurotransmission and is potentiated by fluoxetine {(Prozac).} The basal and enhanced slowing responses are distinct and separable neuromodulatory components of a genetically tractable paradigm of behavioral plasticity.},

Here, we show that the space of shapes adopted by the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans is low dimensional, with just four dimensions accounting for 95\% of the shape variance. These dimensions provide a quantitative description of worm behavior, and we partially reconstruct “equations of motion” for the dynamics in this space. These dynamics have multiple attractors, and we find that the worm visits these in a rapid and almost completely deterministic response to weak thermal stimuli. Stimulus-dependent correlations among the different modes suggest that one can generate more reliable behaviors by synchronizing stimuli to the state of the worm in shape space. We confirm this prediction, effectively “steering” the worm in real time.},

A central problem in simultaneous imaging is that the field of view of the high-power objective required for imaging the neuron is often too small to allow the experimenter to assess the overall behavioral state of the animal. Here we present a method that solves this problem using a microscope with two objectives focused on the preparation: a high-power lens dedicated to imaging the neuron and low-power lens dedicated to imaging the behavior. Images of activity and behavior are acquired simultaneously but separately using different wavelengths of light. The new approach was tested using the cameleon calcium sensor expressed in Caenorhabditis elegans sensory neurons. We show that simultaneous recordings of neuronal activity and behavior are practical in C. elegans and, moreover, that such recordings can reveal subtle, transient correlations between calcium levels and behavior that may be missed in nonsimultaneous recordings. The new method is likely to be useful whenever it would be desirable to record simultaneously at two different spatial resolutions from a single location, or from two different locations in space.},

Here we present a new class of microfluidic devices for C. elegans neurobiology and behavior: agarose-free, micron-scale chambers and channels that allow the animals to crawl as they would on agarose. One such device mimics a moist soil matrix and facilitates rapid delivery of fluid-borne stimuli. A second device consists of sinusoidal channels that can be used to regulate the waveform and trajectory of crawling worms. Both devices are thin and transparent, rendering them compatible with high-resolution microscope objectives for neuronal imaging and optical recording. Together, the new devices are likely to accelerate studies of the neuronal basis of behavior in C. elegans.},

Having earlier adapted a light-activated cation channel, channelrhodopsin-2 {(ChR2)}, for allowing neurons to be stimulated by blue light, we searched for a complementary tool that would enable optical neuronal inhibition, driven by light of a second color. Here we report that targeting the codon-optimized form of the light-driven chloride pump halorhodopsin from the archaebacterium Natronomas pharaonis (hereafter abbreviated Halo) to genetically-specified neurons enables them to be silenced reliably, and reversibly, by millisecond-timescale pulses of yellow light. We show that trains of yellow and blue light pulses can drive high-fidelity sequences of hyperpolarizations and depolarizations in neurons simultaneously expressing yellow light-driven Halo and blue light-driven {ChR2}, allowing for the first time manipulations of neural synchrony without perturbation of other parameters such as spiking rates. The {Halo/ChR2} system thus constitutes a powerful toolbox for multichannel photoinhibition and photostimulation of virally or transgenically targeted neural circuits without need for exogenous chemicals, enabling systematic analysis and engineering of the brain, and quantitative bioengineering of excitable cells.},

We show here that the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans exhibits a strong behavioural preference for 5-12\% oxygen, avoiding higher and lower oxygen levels. 3',5'-cyclic guanosine monophosphate {(cGMP)} is a common second messenger in sensory transduction and is implicated in oxygen sensation. Avoidance of high oxygen levels by C. elegans requires the sensory {cGMP-gated} channel tax-2/tax-4 and a specific soluble guanylate cyclase homologue, gcy-35. The {GCY-35} haem domain binds molecular oxygen, unlike the haem domains of classical nitric-oxide-regulated guanylate cyclases. {GCY-35} and {TAX-4} mediate oxygen sensation in four sensory neurons that control a naturally polymorphic social feeding behaviour in C. elegans. Social feeding and related behaviours occur only when oxygen exceeds C. elegans' preferred level, and require gcy-35 activity. Our results suggest that {GCY-35} is regulated by molecular oxygen, and that social feeding can be a behavioural strategy for responding to hyperoxic environments.},

The integrated performance of circuits for sensorimotor control may be analyzed by quantifying an animal's motile behavior in defined sensory environments. Here, we analyze the ability of the nematode C. elegans to crawl isothermally in spatial thermal gradients by quantifying the trajectories of individual worms responding to defined spatiotemporal thermal gradients. We show that sensorimotor control during isothermal tracking may be summarized as a strategy in which the worm changes the curvature of its propulsive undulations in response to temperature changes measured at its head. We show that a concise mathematical model for this strategy for sensorimotor control is consistent with the exquisite stability of the worm's isothermal alignment in spatial thermal gradients as well as its more complex trajectories in spatiotemporal thermal gradients.},

	abstract = {Echolocating bats emit sonar pulses and listen to returning echoes to probe their surroundings. Bats adapt their echolocation call design to cope with dynamic changes in the acoustic environment, including habitat change or the presence of nearby conspecifics/heterospecifics. Seven pairs of big brown bats, Eptesicus fuscus, were tested in this study to examine how they adjusted their echolocation calls when flying and competing with a conspecific for food. Results showed that differences in five call parameters, start/end frequencies, duration, bandwidth and sweep rate, significantly increased in the two-bat condition compared with the baseline data. In addition, the magnitude of spectral separation of calls was negatively correlated with the baseline call design differences in individual bats. Bats with small baseline call frequency differences showed larger increases in call frequency separation when paired than those with large baseline call frequency differences, suggesting that bats actively change their sonar call structure if pre-existing differences in call design are small. Call design adjustments were also influenced by physical spacing between two bats. Calls of paired bats exhibited the largest design separations when inter-bat distance was shorter than 0.5 m, and the separation decreased as the spacing increased. All individuals modified at least one baseline call parameter in response to the presence of another conspecific. We propose that dissimilarity between the time-frequency features of sonar calls produced by different bats aids each individual in segregating echoes of its own sonar vocalizations from the acoustic signals of neighboring bats.},

The single neuron M4 was necessary and sufficient for isthmus peristalsis. The {MC} neurons were necessary for normal stimulation of pumping in response to food, but pumping continued and was functional in {MC-} worms. The remaining 12 neuron types were also unnecessary for functional pumping. No operation we did, including destruction of the entire pharyngeal nervous system, abolished pumping altogether. When we killed all pharyngeal neurons except M4, the worms were viable and fertile, although retarded and starved. Since feeding is one of the few known essential actions controlled by the nervous system, we suggest that most of the C. elegans nervous system is dispensable in hermaphrodites under laboratory conditions. This may explain the ease with which nervous system mutants are isolated and handled in C. elegans.},

The similar structures of the phasmids and the amphid chemosensory organs in the head have long suggested a chemosensory function for the phasmids. However, the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons are not required for chemotaxis or for dauer formation, and no direct proof of a chemosensory function of the phasmids has been obtained. C. elegans avoids toxic chemicals by reversing its movement, and this behavior is mediated by sensory neurons of the amphid, particularly, the {ASH} neurons. Here we show that the {PHA} and {PHB} phasmid neurons function as chemosensory cells that negatively modulate reversals to repellents. The antagonistic activity of head and tail sensory neurons is integrated to generate appropriate escape behaviors: detection of a repellent by head neurons mediates reversals, which are suppressed by antagonistic inputs from tail neurons. Our results suggest that C. elegans senses repellents by defining a head-to-tail spatial map of the chemical environment.},

	abstract = {We have cloned a gene encoding a fluorescent protein from a stony coral, Trachyphyllia geoffroyi, which emits green, yellow, and red light. The protein, named Kaede, includes a tripeptide, {His-Tyr-Gly}, that acts as a green chromophore that can be converted to red. The red fluorescence is comparable in intensity to the green and is stable under usual aerobic conditions. We found that the green-red conversion is highly sensitive to irradiation with {UV} or violet light (350-400 nm), which excites the protonated form of the chromophore. The excitation lights used to elicit red and green fluorescence do not induce photoconversion. Under a conventional epifluorescence microscope, Kaede protein expressed in {HeLa} cells turned red in a graded fashion in response to {UV} illumination; maximal illumination resulted in a 2,000-fold increase in the ratio of red-to-green signal. These color-changing properties provide a simple and powerful technique for regional optical marking. A focused {UV} pulse creates an instantaneous plane source of red Kaede within the cytosol. The red spot spreads rapidly throughout the cytosol, indicating its free diffusibility in the compartment. The extensive diffusion allows us to delineate a single neuron in a dense culture, where processes originating from many different somata are present. Illumination of a focused {UV} pulse onto the soma of a Kaede-expressing neuron resulted in filling of all processes with red fluorescence, allowing visualization of contact sites between the red and green neurons of interest.},

We tested this hypothesis directly by recording the activity of these motoneurons during semirestrained locomotion. For this purpose, we used epifluorescence imaging of the genetically encoded calcium sensor cameleon, expressed in specific motoneurons, while monitoring locomotor behavior through the microscope condenser using a second camera. We found that ventral and dorsal B-motoneurons {(DB} and {VB)} were coactive during forward locomotion while ventral A-motoneurons {(VA)} were only active during backward locomotion. The signals we recorded correlated with the direction of locomotion but not with the faster undulatory cycles. To our knowledge, these are the first recordings of motoneuron activity in C. elegans and the only direction-dedicated motoneurons described to date.},

A first step in determining the cellular mechanisms of this learning is to identify the neuronal circuitry that underlies this reflex. Studies by Chalfie et al.

We used the touch circuit as a starting point in the identification of the tap withdrawal circuitry. Here we report the effects of lesions of identified neurons on the tap withdrawal reflex. Ablations of the sensory neurons and interneurons of the touch circuit produce effects on the tap withdrawal response that generally confirm and expand upon the roles of these cells in mechanosensory integration as proposed by Chalfie et al. (1985). However, no role for the {LUA} interneurons could be identified in the production of the tap withdrawal response. Furthermore, the effects of ablating some neurons outside the touch circuit suggest roles for two of these cells in the integration of the tap withdrawal response. Ablation of either the midline neuron {DVA} or the {PVD} neurons resulted in a decrease in both the frequency and magnitude of reversals that were elicited by tap. Additionally, the ablation of either cell decreased the magnitude of accelerations produced by animals in response to tap.},

In contrast to the sensation of touch produced by contact with an object, the perception of object location arises from the interpretation of tactile signals in the context of the changing configuration of the body. A discrete sensory representation and a low number of degrees of freedom in the motor plant make the ethologically prominent rat vibrissa system an ideal model for the study of the neuronal computations that underlie this perception. We found that rats with only a single vibrissa can combine touch and movement to distinguish the location of objects that vary in angle along the sweep of vibrissa motion. The patterns of this motion and of the corresponding behavioral responses show that rats can scan potential locations and decide which location contains a stimulus within 150 ms. This interval is consistent with just one to two whisk cycles and provides constraints on the underlying perceptual computation. Our data argue against strategies that do not require the integration of sensory and motor modalities. The ability to judge angular position with a single vibrissa thus connects previously described, motion-sensitive neurophysiological signals to perception in the behaving animal.},

The unique optical control of neurons within a variety of organisms provided by optogenetics allows researchers to probe neural circuits and investigate neuronal function in a highly specific and controllable fashion. Recently, optogenetic techniques have been introduced to investigate synaptic transmission in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. For synaptic transmission studies, although quantitative, this technique is manual and very low-throughput. As it is, it is difficult to apply this technique to genetic studies. In this paper, we enhance this new tool by combining it with microfluidics technology and computer automation. This allows us to increase the assay throughput by several orders of magnitude as compared to the current standard approach, as well as improving standardization and consistency in data gathering. We also demonstrate the ability to infuse drugs to worms during optogenetic experiments using microfluidics.

	abstract = {Bat echolocation calls provide remarkable examples of 'good design' through evolution by natural selection. Theory developed from acoustics and sonar engineering permits a strong predictive basis for understanding echolocation performance. Call features, such as frequency, bandwidth, duration and pulse interval are all related to ecological niche. Recent technological breakthroughs have aided our understanding of adaptive aspects of call design in free-living bats. Stereo videogrammetry, laser scanning of habitat features and acoustic flight path tracking permit reconstruction of the flight paths of echolocating bats relative to obstacles and prey in nature. These methods show that echolocation calls are among the most intense airborne vocalizations produced by animals. Acoustic tracking has clarified how and why bats vary call structure in relation to flight speed. Bats using broadband echolocation calls adjust call design in a range-dependent manner so that nearby obstacles are localized accurately. Recent phylogenetic analyses based on gene sequences show that particular types of echolocation signals have evolved independently in several lineages of bats. Call design is often influenced more by perceptual challenges imposed by the environment than by phylogeny, and provides excellent examples of convergent evolution. Now that whole genome sequences of bats are imminent, understanding the functional genomics of echolocation will become a major challenge.},

	abstract = {The soil dwelling nematode, Caenorhabditis {(C.)} elegans, is a popular model system for studying behavioral plasticity. Noticeably absent from the C. elegans literature, however, are studies evaluating worm behavior in mazes. Here, we report the use of microfluidic mazes to investigate exploration and learning behaviors in wild-type C. elegans, as well as in the dopamine-poor mutant, cat-2. The key research findings include: {(1)C.} elegans worms are motivated to explore complex spatial environments with or without the presence of food/reward, (2) wild-type worms exhibit a greater tendency to explore relative to mutant worms, (3) both wild-type and mutant worms can learn to make unconditioned responses to food/reward, and (4) wild-type worms are significantly more likely to learn to make conditioned responses linking reward to location than mutant worms. These results introduce microfluidic mazes as a valuable new tool for biological behavioral analysis.},

	abstract = {Thermal stimulus is an important environmental factor influencing animal behaviour. However, the mechanisms underlying thermosensation and thermal adaptation are poorly understood. The nematode Caenorhabditis elegans can sense a range of environmental temperatures and migrate towards the cultivation temperature on a thermal gradient. This modifiable thermotactic response provides an ideal system for studying the cellular and molecular processes involved in thermosensation and thermal information storage. We have identified neurons critical for thermotaxis by killing individual cells in live animals. The results indicate that an amphid sensory neuron, {AFD}, is a major thermosensory neuron. Some of the genetically defined cryophilic and thermophilic mutant phenotypes were mimicked when amphid interneurons {AIY} and {AIZ}, respectively, were killed, indicating that {AIY} is responsible for thermophilic movement and {AIZ} for cryophilic movement. We propose a neural model in which regulation of the activities of the two interneurons in opposite directions, depending on the cultivation temperature, is essential for thermotaxis.},

The aim of this study was to evaluate the differentiation of human nasal epithelial cells {(HNEC)} after wound healing and the potential effects of {TGF-β1.}

Basal, mucous and ciliated cells were characterized by cytokeratin-14, {MUC5AC} and {βIVtubulin} immunodetection, respectively. Their expression was evaluated in situ in nasal polyps and in an in vitro model of wound healing in primary cultures of {HNEC} after wound closure, under basal conditions and after {TGF-β1} supplementation. Using {RT-PCR}, the effects of {TGF-β1} on {MUC5AC} and {DNAI1} genes, specifically transcribed in mucous and ciliated cells, were evaluated.

In situ, high {TGF-β1} expression was associated with low {MUC5AC} and {βIVtubulin} expression. In vitro, under basal conditions, {MUC5AC} expression remained stable, cytokeratin-14 expression was strong and decreased with time, while {βIV} tubulin expression increased. {TGF-β1} supplementation down-regulated {MUC5AC} and {βIV} tubulin expression as well as {MUC5AC} and {DNAI1} transcripts.

After a wound, differentiation into mucous and ciliated cells was possible and partially inhibited in vitro by {TGF-β1}, a cytokine that may be involved in epithelial remodeling observed in chronic airway diseases.},

	abstract = {A common explanation of molecular recognition by the olfactory system posits that receptors recognize the structure or shape of the odorant molecule. We performed a rigorous test of shape recognition by replacing hydrogen with deuterium in odorants and asking whether Drosophila melanogaster can distinguish these identically shaped isotopes. We report that flies not only differentiate between isotopic odorants, but can be conditioned to selectively avoid the common or the deuterated isotope. Furthermore, flies trained to discriminate against the normal or deuterated isotopes of a compound, selectively avoid the corresponding isotope of a different odorant. Finally, flies trained to avoid a deuterated compound exhibit selective aversion to an unrelated molecule with a vibrational mode in the energy range of the carbon–deuterium stretch. These findings are inconsistent with a shape-only model for smell, and instead support the existence of a molecular vibration-sensing component to olfactory reception.},

	abstract = {Habituation has traditionally been considered a nonassociative form of learning. However, recent research suggests that retention of this nonassociative form of learning may be aided by associations formed during training. An example of this is context conditioning, in which animals that are trained and tested in the presence of a contextual cue show greater retention than animals trained and tested in different environments. This article reports context conditioning in habituation in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans. The results showed that retention of habituation to tap at both 10- and 60-s interstimulus intervals was significantly greater if training and testing occurred in the presence of the same chemosensory cue {(NaCH3COO).} This context conditioning showed both extinction and latent inhibition, demonstrating that these simple worms with only 302 neurons are capable of associative context conditioning.},
