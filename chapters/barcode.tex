\chapter{Sub-micrometer Geometrically Encoded Fluorescent Barcodes Self-Assembled from DNA}

\section{Introduction}
%Comment to chenxiang: found the beginning cheesy,modified it a bit
\newthought{In biology and medicine} researchers often use fluorescence microscopy to visualize nanometer to micrometer-sized entities. In many cases it is desirable to visualize more than one class of objects simultaneously and unambiguously. As such there is a need to develop suitable 
fluorescent tags (barcodes) for multiplexed imaging applications. Most previously 
described fluorescent barcodes are constructed using either intensity encoding \citep{han_quantum-dot-tagged_2001,xu_multiplexed_2003,li_multiplexed_2005,livet_transgenic_2007,fournier-bidoz_facile_2008,lin_self-assembled_2007,marcon_--fly_2010} or 
geometrical encoding \citep{nicewarner-pena_submicrometer_2001,gudiksen_growth_2002,braeckmans_encoding_2003,dejneka_rare_2003,geiss_direct_2008,pregibon_multifunctional_2007,xiao_direct_2009,li_controlled_2010}. Intensity encoding relies on the combination of multiple 
spectrally differentiable fluorophores in a controlled molar ratio. Geometrical encoding, 
on the other hand, is obtained by separating optical features beyond the microscope’s 
resolution limit (typically \textasciitilde250 nm for diffraction-limited imaging and \textasciitilde 50 nm for 
current super-resolution imaging) and arranging them in a specific geometric pattern.
%ANDY ADDED the following
Here we combine both intensity and geometric methods. The multiplexing capability of geometrically encoded barcodes increases 
exponentially as additional spatially distinguishable fluorophores are incorporated. 
Therefore, larger barcode libraries may be more easily accessible through geometrical 
encoding, provided that a rigid structural scaffold capable of defining the spatial 
arrangement of the fluorescent molecules is available. To date, despite the remarkable 
success in synthesizing fluorescent barcodes for in vitro multiplexed detection, very little 
effort has been made to create robust single-molecule barcodes suitable as in situ imaging 
probes. In addition, most existing fluorescent barcodes range from 2 \textmu m to 100 \textmu m in 
size, leaving the construction of fluorescent barcodes with largest dimension less than 1 
\textmu m an underexplored research area (with only a few reports  \citep{li_multiplexed_2005,lin_self-assembled_2007,li_controlled_2010,levsky_single-cell_2002} and no more than 11 
distinct barcodes experimentally demonstrated). Here we report a group of geometrically and intensity 
encoded fluorescent barcodes self-assembled from DNA that can be used to tag yeast 
cells. These barcodes are 400–800 nm in length, structurally rigid, biocompatible, 
reprogrammable in a modular fashion and easy to decode using epi-fluorescence, total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) or 
super-resolution fluorescence microscopy. As evidence of the multiplexing power of the 
system, 216 distinct barcode species (20 times more than previously experimentally 
demonstrated systems) were constructed and resolved using diffraction-limited TIRF 
microscopy. 

%Comment for Chenxiang: Way Way Way too many references. Many of these are wholly irrelevant! 
Structural DNA nanotechnology takes advantage of the well-defined double 
helical structure of DNA and the highly predictable Watson-Crick base-paring rules to 
self-assemble designer nano-objects and devices \citep{seeman_nucleic_1982,aldaye_assembling_2008,lin_designer_2009,nangreave_dna_2010,shih_knitting_2010,trring_dna_2011}. In recent years, DNA origami has 
emerged as a prominent method to fabricate two- and three-dimensional structures with 
sizes of tens to hundreds of nanometers \citep{rothemund_folding_2006,douglas_self-assembly_2009,dietz_folding_2009,ke_multilayer_2009,andersen_self-assembly_2009,han_folding_2010,liedl_self-assembly_2010,han_dna_2011}. By folding a long, single-stranded DNA 
molecule (a scaffold strand, often times an M13 viral genomic DNA or its derivatives) 
with the help of many short synthetic DNA oligonucleotides (staple strands), this 
approach generates complex, shape-controlled, fully addressable nanostructures. With 
certain functional groups attached to selected staple strands or their extensions, such 
nanostructures can be used to organize fluorescent guest molecules, including small 
organic molecules \citep{jungmann_single-molecule_2010,steinhauer_dna_2009,lund_molecular_2010} as well as metallic \citep{pal_dna-origami-directed_2010} and semi-conductive nano-particles \citep{bui_programmable_2010}. In 
addition, individual DNA-origami nanostructures can be joined together in a 
programmable way to make micrometer-sized structures while maintaining their unique 
nanometer scale spatial addressability \citep{liu_crystalline_2011,woo_programmable_2011}. These properties make DNA origami 
promising material to build robust fluorescent barcodes, as control over the exact ratio of 
different fluorophores allows intensity encoding while spatial positioning of fluorophores 
facilitates geometrical encoding and can help minimize undesired inter-fluorophore 
quenching. 

\section{A Simple DNA Origami Barcode}
As a proof-of-concept demonstration, we first designed a family of 27 barcodes 
based on six-helix bundle DNA nanotubes \citep{douglas_dna-nanotube-induced_2007} that are ~800 nm long. Figure \ref{fig:dna1}a illustrates 
the design of such barcodes. Three 84-base pair (\textasciitilde28 nm) zones on the nanotube were 
selected for fluorescent labeling, with inter-zone distances of 450 nm and 270 nm 
between the first and the last two zones, respectively. In this design, the fluorescently 
labeled zones were separated beyond the diffraction limit of visible light (\textasciitilde250 nm) and 
the symmetry of the nanotube was broken so that the barcodes could be geometrically 
encoded with a distinguishable “head” and “tail”. For example, labeling the three zones 
(from left to right in Figure \ref{fig:dna1}a) with “Blue” (B, Alexa Fluor 488), “Red” (R, Alexa Fluor 
647) and “Green” (G, Cy3) fluorophores (the pseudo-colors were assigned to reflect the 
excitation wavelength of the fluorophores) resulted in a BRG barcode that should be 
distinguishable from a GRB barcode. Therefore, a total of $3^{3}=27$ different barcodes can 
be made from three spectrally distinguishable fluorophores. Within each zone (Figure 
\ref{fig:dna1}b), fluorescently modified oligonucleotides were hybridized to the twelve 21-base long 
staple extensions protruding out from the main body of the nanotube. The distance 
between adjacent staple extensions was \textasciitilde6 nm. In order to image these prototype 
barcodes in our prototype experiments, ten additional staple strands (five per monomer) 
were designed with 5' biotinylated extensions to enable surface attachment (See Figure 
\ref{fig:dnaS1} for the full design blueprint as strand diagram).

the Blue--Red-Green (BRG, “--” and “-” denotes larger and smaller inter-zone distance in

dimerizing two origami monomers, each consisting of 28 segments of length 42-bp (13.6 nm).
The grey segment in the middle represents the junction where the two monomers 
are joined together through cross-hybridization between their scaffolds and staples. Three 
84-bp zones of the nanotube are fluorescently labeled (shown as blue, red and green 
segments) to produce the BRG barcode with an inter-zone distance of 450 nm between 
the first two zones and 270 nm between the last two. Note that each zone is only labeled 
with one fluorophore species. The resulting barcodes are thus referred as single-labeled- 
zone barcodes. (\textbf{b}) 3D cartoons showing the details of one fluorescently labeled zone.

region at the 5'-end weaves through three double-helices to fold the scaffold (shown in 
black) into a six-helix bundle nanotube; and the 21-base extension at the 3'-end protrudes 
out for fluorescent labeling. Middle: an identical but simplified model to emphasize the

\subsection{Construction of Simple Barcode}
We assembled the DNA-origami nanotubes following the protocol in \citep{douglas_dna-nanotube-induced_2007} with slight experimental modifications (See Materials and Methods in SI). 
Briefly, two structurally identical but chemically distinct nanotube monomers (\textasciitilde400 nm 
each) were assembled in two separate test tubes by slowly cooling a mixture of 7.3-kb 
scaffold strands and a set of \textasciitilde200 staple strands from 80 \textdegree C to 24 \textdegree C over 15 hours. After 
folding, excessive staple strands were removed from the folded nanotubes through 
polyethylene glycol fractionation. The nanotube monomers were then incubated with the 
desired fluorescently modified oligonucleotides and the labeled monomers were mixed at 
an equimolar ratio to form the final barcode structure. The barcodes were subsequently 
purified via agarose-gel electrophoresis and immobilized on streptavidin-coated 
coverslips before imaging with epi-fluorescence (Figure \ref{fig:dna_s2}) or TIRF microscopy (Figure 
\ref{fig:dna2} and \ref{fig:dna3}) in the presence of oxygen scavenging reagents \citep{liedl_self-assembly_2010}.

types are expected. As a result the bars and pie representing the qualified barcodes in (\textbf{c}) 
are shown in blue. Scale bars: 5 \textmu m.\label{fig:dna2}}

\subsection{Inspecting the simple barcodes}
In order to validate our system, we randomly chose five distinct barcodes from the
%Note to Chenxiang: What does it mean to "validate" the system? what specifically are you doing this section?
% Aren't you really just inspecting the barcodes and confrimng that they look as expected?
27 members in the barcode family for quality control experiments. The barcodes were 
assembled and purified separately and imaged under the same experimental conditions. 
Two distinct features of the barcode were clearly visible from the TIRF images (Figure 
\ref{fig:dna2}a, top panel and Figure \ref{fig:dna_s3}): first, each fluorescently labeled zone on a barcode was 
resolved as a single-color spot and each complete barcode consisted of three of such 
spots; second, two of the neighboring spots were separated by a small gap while the other 
two neighbors sat closely together. Therefore one can visually recognize and decode 
those geometrically encoded barcodes based on the color identity of the spots and their 
relative spatial positions, even without the aid of any specialized decoding software. 
Using a custom-written software that localizes the center of each spot on the BRG 
barcodes (Figure \ref{fig:dna_s4}), we measured the average center-to-center distance between the 
neighboring spots to be 433$\pm$53 nm (mean$\pm$s.d., N=70; larger distance) and 264$\pm$52 nm 
(mean $\pm$ s.d., N=70; smaller distance), confirming the correct formation of the barcodes. 
These experimentally measured distances were slightly smaller than the designed values 
(478 nm and 298 nm). We attribute this discrepancy to random thermal bending of the 
nanotubes (persistence length of \textasciitilde1–2 \textmu m), which has been observed previously by 
others \citep{rothemund_folding_2006, han_folding_2010} and confirmed by us (Figure \ref{fig:dna_s5}) using transmission electron microscopy 
(TEM). It is important to note that unlike some other geometrically encoded barcoding 
systems (e.g., NanoString nCounter \citep{geiss_direct_2008}), there was no molecular combing step involved in
%Note to Chenxiang: is this the best place to put hthe nanostring comparison? It disrupts the rest of the already long paragraph.
the sample preparation. The separation between the fluorescent spots was exclusively 
created by the inherently rigid structure of the six-helix bundle nanotube. It is also 
notable that the spot intensities were not perfectly uniform across the whole image, which 
can be explained by factors such as the uneven illumination of the sample stage and 
differences in labeling efficiency. Nevertheless, the TIRF images proved that the 
barcodes were successfully assembled and can be resolved unambiguously.

\subsection{Quantification of the yield of the simple barcodes}
We then %I added a paragraph break here -AML
manually investigated TIRF images with an area of 50×50 \textmu m$^2$ for the five selected 
barcodes (Figure \ref{fig:dna2}a, bottom panel). The objects found within the images were first sorted 
into qualified (i.e., three single-color spots arranged in a nearly linear and asymmetric 
fashion as designed) and unqualified (i.e., all other objects) barcodes. The qualified 
barcodes were further categorized into correct and incorrect (false-positive) barcodes 
based on the fluorescent signatures of the composing spots to reflect whether the barcode 
was the expected type. The unqualified barcodes were further sorted into (1) monomer 
nanotubes (single spot or two “kissing” spots), (2) barcodes with “wrong” geometry (i.e., 
extreme bending), and (3) barcodes containing at least one spot with multiple colors. Our 
statistics revealed that more than 70\% of the visible objects were qualified barcodes, 
which we further determined to be exclusively the expected type (i.e., zero false-positive 
out of 188 qualified barcodes observed). The unqualified barcodes likely arose from 
folding defects, sample damage during handling and overlapping nanotubes on the 
surface, which can be largely reduced by optimizing the sample preparation and imaging 
protocol. 

%strike "real-life" added "useful" --AML
To be useful for multiplexed imaging system, a number of different barcode species must
coexist in one pool. Thus it is important to examine the robustness of our system by 
mixing different types of barcode together. In an initial test, we synthesized BRG and 
RGB barcodes separately, mixed them together at equal molar ratio and co-purified them 
via gel electrophoresis. The TIRF analysis of the purified mixture (Figure \ref{fig:dna_s6}) confirmed 
the 1:1 stoichiometry of the two barcodes and the overall assembly success rate (qualified 
barcode/all objects) of \textasciitilde80\%, suggesting that both barcodes maintained their integrity in 
the mixing and co-purification process. In addition, over 98\% of the qualified barcodes 
fell into one of the two expected types (BRG and RGB). The 2\% false-positive rate was 
due to an unexpected barcode, namely BGB (Figure \ref{fig:dna_s6}), which could be attributed to a 
rare occasion in which the front monomer of the BRG barcode lay in proximity to the 
rear monomer of the RGB barcode. We believe this could be eliminated in the future if a 
more stringent purification condition is applied to minimize the amount of leftover 
monomers.  


%We should do a better job with organization here.. this is a very very long section, without much direction. Perhaps we could make clear the different instances with which we will inspect barcodes...
We next inspect barcodes when all 27 members of the barcode family were mixed at equimolar amount. The TIRF images 
(Figure \ref{fig:dna2}b and Figure \ref{fig:dna_s7}) showed that all types of barcodes were resolved. Statistical 
analyses of twenty-seven 50×50 \textmu m$^2$ images (\textasciitilde1,500 barcodes in total) revealed an 
average count of 55 per barcode type with a standard deviation of 9 (Figure \ref{fig:dna2}c), fitting 
well with the expected stoichiometry considering pipetting and sampling errors. The 
distribution of observed objects over the four categories (note that here correct vs. 
incorrect barcodes were not distinguishable as all 27 types were included) was consistent 
with the values measured from the single-type barcode samples. The above observations 
suggest that the sub-micrometer-long DNA nanotube represents a reliable platform to 
construct geometrically encoded barcodes with built-in structural rigidity.

Our modular design enabled straightforward reengineering of the barcode to 
enhance its multiplexing capability through a variety of ways. For example, we changed 
the sequence of six staple extensions per zone so that instead of using twelve identical 
fluorescent oligonucleotides for labeling, we had the ability to use the combination of up 
to two fluorophores to create more unique fluorescence signatures (pseudo-colors) for 
%In the language of the introduction, this is an intensity strategy --AML
each zone. Six pseudo-colors (B, R, G, BG, BR, and GR) were generated by this “dual- 
labeling” strategy using three spectrally differentiable fluorophores. Consequently, the 
total number of distinct barcodes was raised from $3^3=27$ to $6^3=216$, which represented 
an order of magnitude increase in the multiplexing capability. 

\subsection{Inspecting the dual-labeled barcodes}
Similar to the single- 
labeled-zone barcode family, 5 members from the dual-labeled-zone barcode family were 
chosen for quality control purposes. The barcodes can be visually decoded either solely 
from the superimposed image or by examining all different channels simultaneously. For 
example, as shown in the first column of Figure \ref{fig:dna3}a, the barcode “BG--GR-BR” (“--” and 
“-” denotes larger and smaller inter-zone distance in the barcode, respectively) exhibits
two spots each in the blue, green and red channels but with descending gaps between 
them, matching its design. In the superimposed image, the barcodes are seen as Cyan-- 
Yellow-Pink, an expected consequence of color mixing caused by the dual-labeling 
strategy. In a similar fashion, we further verified the correct formation of the other four 
selected barcodes (Figure \ref{fig:dna3}a and \ref{fig:dna_s8}). Although the final pseudo-color from the dual- 
labeled zones was not always uniform (e.g., some yellow spots were green-tinted while 
the others were red-tinted) due to inconsistent labeling efficiency and minor sample 
displacement during imaging, the fluorescence signature of any given spot could be 
identified by checking the raw images acquired from the three imaging channels. We 
manually analyzed two 50×50 \textmu m$^2$ images of each dual-labeled-zone barcode and 
plotted the statistical data in Figure \ref{fig:dna3}b. Here, objects were sorted into qualified barcodes 
and unqualified barcodes based on their geometry and the qualified ones were further 
categorized as either correct or incorrect. We found that 75–95\% of the objects were 
qualified barcodes, among which 80–90\% were the correct type (percentage varies 
depending on the exact type of barcode). Compared to the single-labeled-zone barcode 
family, the percentage of qualified barcodes remained the same, while the false positive 
rate increased significantly from zero (Figure 1a) to 10–20\%. That the

false positive rate increases is consistent with the increased information entropy in the system (216 possible barcodes compared to 27).
