To cross the threshold from where we are to where we want to be, major conceptual shifts must take place in how we study the brain. One such shift will be from studying elementary processes---single proteins, single genes, and single cells---to studying systems properties---mechanisms made up of many proteins, complex systems of nerve cells, the functioning of whole organisms, and the interaction of groups of organisms. Cellular and molecular approaches will certainly continue to yield important information in the future, but they cannot by themselves unravel the secrets of internal representations of neural circuits or the interaction of circuits---the key steps linking cellular and molecular neuroscience to cognitive neuroscience.

This question motivated my thesis work and prompted me to develop new tools and techniques that use image processing, microscopy and optogenetics to probe the nervous system of the nematode \emph{C. elegans}. That work is covered in Chapters \ref{chapter:colbert}, \ref{chapter:proprioceptive} and  \ref{chapter:omegaTurn}. Along the way, I employed similar techniques  towards the development of  novel fluorescent reporter constructs for next generation microarray and lab-on a chip technologies. That work is discussed in Chapter \ref{chapter:DNAbarcode} and \ref{chapter:DNAtheory}. The neuronal basis of behavior, however, remains the focus of this introduction.

\section{Background}
Neurons are the fundamental unit of the brain.  They are responsible for encoding information from an organism's environment and performing computations to transform that information into  behavior.  

%Differentiate single cell and system


The field of systems neuroscience seeks to understand this chain of events from environmental input to motor output, and it seeks to do so at the level of an entire neural circuit or even an entire organism. Our understanding has been limited in part by the lack of tools to probe and observe the activity of ensembles of neurons on a whole-organism scale. Recently, a confluence of advances now make this possible.

\subsection{\textit{C. elegans} as a model organism}

Invertabrate model organisms have taught us many general principles about neuroscience (Our understanding the molecular basis of learning came initially from the the studied aplysia, a giant sea slug. ) Our understanding of motor circuits, even for humans, is informed by early studies of leech and lamprey. 

The nematode \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} has emerged as a popular and robust model organism and a natural tool to study systems neuroscience. With only 302 neurons, its nervous system is compact, but tractable. The 1 mm long nematode exhibits a rich array of behaviors \citep{croll_components_1975}. It senses its environment,  navigates towards  food \cite{grewal_migration_1992}  and temperatures \cite{ryu_thermotaxis_2002} that it prefers,  avoids chemicals that it dislikes \citep{croll_behavoural_1975}, and responds to touch \citep{chalfie_neural_1985}. The worm even exhibits associative learning, it can learn to associate odors with foods that makes it sick and then it will avoid them \citep{zhang_pathogenic_2005}. 

Starting in the 1970's White et al \citep{white_structure_1976, white_structure_1986}  mapped out the entire wiring diagram of the \textit{C. elegans} nervous system. The individual neurons are morphologically identifiable and their connectivity is stereotyped from one worm to the next. The  scientific community has thus been able to systematically study individual neurons and use tools such as laser ablation and transgenics to identify which neurons are part of which neural circuits. 

Critically, \textit{C. elegans} is also a major platform for molecular genetics and genetic engineering. It was the first organism into which the fluorescent reporter gene GFP was cloned \citep{chalfie_green_1994},  and it was the first multicellular eukaryote to have its genome sequenced \citep{sulston_c._1992,_genome_1998}. The nematode is especially convenient for genetic engineering. The worms have a fast generation time--a worm grows from egg to egg-laying adult at room temperature in about four days--and they are naturally hermaphroditic and they self reproduce,  making it trivial to maintain isogenic lines. New genes can be added to the worm by injecting plasmids which are incorporated into an extrachromosomal array. The worms are then irradiated, and their DNA damage repair pathway incorporates the plasmids into their chromosomes to form stable transgenic lines.  In the hands of skilled geneticists, the whole process including outcrossing takes less than a month. 

Importantly, \textit{C. elegans} is also optically transparent and thus particularly amenable to advances in optical physiology and microscopy. These are the primary tools used in this work. 

These attributes have made  \textit{C. elegans}  extremely well studied, and as a result, there is a rich repository of knowledge and resources available to the \textit{C. elegans} research community. Among resources used commonly in this work are:  WormBase, an online database of genes, phenotypes, and publications \citep{harris_wormbase:_2010}; WormAtlas, a comprehensive online anatomical resource providing details of every neuron and cell \citep{altun_wormatlas_2002}; WormBook, a curated collection of review articles and methods \citep{the_c._elegans_research_community_wormbook_2011}; WormWeb, an online interactive network of neural connectivity \citep{bhatla_c._2009};  and the \textit{Caenorhabditis} Genetics Center at the University of Minnesota which acts as a central repository and distributor for transgenic \textit{C. elegans} lines.


%There is a long history of using model organisms including invertebrates for neuroscience discovery. In the past \textit{Aplysia} has been used to study learning \citep{castellucci_neuronal_1970}, leech and lamprey for locomotion \citep{briggman_imaging_2006} and \textit{Drosophila} \citep{zhang_drosophila_2010} for a variety of nervous system functions. 
\textit{C. elegans}, with its compact nervous system, genetic tractability,  optical access and well-mapped neural circuitry is an ideal candidate for studying the neural dynamics underlying behavior.

\subsection{Optical physiology}
Traditional electrophysiology is challenging to perform in the nematode \textit{C. elegans} \citep{goodman_active_1998, schafer_neurophysiological_2006}. The worm's small size and pressurized fluid-filled body make it difficult for electrodes to gain access to neurons.  As a result, electrophysiology experiments are  performed on worms that are partially dissected and immobilized.

 which negates their ability to elucidate how neural activity correlates to behavior. Advances in optogenetics and fluorescent reporters, however,  offer a viable alternative to electrophysiology and is the technology utilized here.

 

\subsubsection{Optogenetics}
Optogenetics is an emerging field that refers to optical tools based on genetically encoded proteins that manipulate neural function. Karl Deisseroth and Ed Boyden founded the field of optogenetics with their joint development of Channelrhodopsin as an optical method for neural stimulation in  2005 \citep{boyden_millisecond-timescale_2005} and their simultaneous but independent development of Halorhodopsin as a method of neural silencing in 2007 \citep{zhang_multimodal_2007, han_multiple-color_2007}.  For a riveting historical account, see \citep{boyden_history_2011}. Optogenetic proteins like Channelrhodopsin and Halorhodopsin are light-activated transmembrane ion channels that open in response to light stimuli at a particular wavelength \citep{nagel_channelrhodopsin-2_2003, yizhar_optogenetics_2011, fenno_development_2011}. These optogenetic proteins were immediately employed  in \textit{C. elegans}, and early an experiment showed how illuminating worms expressing Channelrhodopsin in their mechanosensory neurons evoked a touch-like response  \citep{nagel_light_2005}.  The field has seen explosive growth in the past five years. For a review of optogenetics in \textit{C. elegans}, including some of the work presented here, see \citep{xu_early_2011} and \citep{yizhar_optogenetics_2011}. In the present work, I use optogenetics as a tool to probe neural activity in a freely moving worm. 

\subsubsection{Fluorescent Reporters of Neural Activity}
Just as optogenetic proteins allow optical stimulation or inhibition of neural activity,  genetically encoded fluorescent reporters provide optical readouts of neural activity.  The first class of genetically encoded reporters were calcium indicators that altered their fluorescent properties in response to the intracellular calcium levels. Calcium in a neuron is often used as a proxy for its membrane potential, and thus calcium indicators serve as an indirect measure of neural activity.   The first genetically encoded calcium indicator was cameleon \citep{miyawaki_fluorescent_1997}, which was a calmodulin protein modified by the addition of a Forster Resonance Energy Transfer (FRET) pair of fluorophores. As intracellular calcium levels increase, calmodulin component of the cameleon contracts pulling the two attached fluorescing proteins closer together, which changes their fluorescence properties. The past decade has seen  steady improvement in genetically encoded calcium indicators that are brighter, more sensitive, and have faster response times \citep{miyawaki_innovations_2005,mank_genetically_2008,yamada_quantitative_2011}. In this work I use one of the most recent indicators, GCaMP3 \citep{tian_imaging_2009}.
 
%Of course, it would be ideal to observe the membrane potential directly instead of merely observing calcium levels and the development of true genetically encoded voltage indicators for \textit{C. elegans} is just around the corner \citep{kralj_electrical_2011}. 

Both optogenetics and calcium indicators are non-invasive and thus in principal allows the worm to remain intact and unrestrained. Previously the Samuel lab was the first to manually track a worm and observe its calcium transients as it freely moved \citep{clark_temporal_2007}. In this thesis I develop an automated system to track the worm and either apply optogenetic stimuli or monitor calcium transients.



\subsection{Real-Time Computer Vision}

%Why do you need to 
%This is necessary to follow a worm 

In addition to the development of optogenetics and fluorescent indicators, the ever decreasing cost of computer power, the ready availability of high power CW lasers in all different wavelengths,  the advent of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS), and the development of powerful open source computer vision libraries, have  all conspired to make the time ripe for an purely-optical investigation of the neural activity that underlies behavior. In particular, computer hardware and open source libraries have recently become available that can performing computer vision analysis in real-time.


Its only been in the last five years that real-time comptuer visoin algorithms have become readily available. 

Fortuitously, the OpenCV library that was in part..... is 

there is a universality of computer vision algorithms that cuts across fields.. advances in one field can readily translate. for example, the OpenCV library in this thesis was developed in large part for the DARPA challenge. 



 For example, the development of the OpenCV library \citep{bradski_opencv_2000,bradski_learning_2008}, used heavily in this thesis, was driven in part by the 2004-2007 DARPA grand challenge competitions where teams competed to create a self-driving autonomous vehicles \citep{stavens_learning_2011,buehler_stanley:_2007}.



\subsection{Applications to Behavioral Neuroscience}

By building upon the technologies discussed above, 
%list technologies: bringing to the model organism C. elegans, optogetenics, genetically encoded calcium indicatiors, real-time computer vision
%At the time this thesis work began, i was the first to bring all of these elements together to study C. elegans
this thesis brings us closer to being able to systematically perturb or monitor neural activity across an entire organism while it is behaving. I use the tools developed here to study  neural activity underlying \emph{C. elegans} locomotion. The worm crawls on its side and propels itself forward by propagating bending waves from its head to tail.  The worm has 95 muscles and 302 neurons. Of those 302 neurons, 113 are classified as motor neurons, meaning that they directly enervate muscles. For successful locomotion, all of these muscles and neurons must work together in a coordinated and coherent fashion. For an excellent review of the \textit{C. elegans}  motor circuit see \citep{von_stetina_motor_2006}. While it is fairly well understood which neurons  in \textit{C. elegans} are required for forward or backward locomotion, the dynamics of neural activity are largely unknown. In fact, many of the community's assumption derive from leech and lamprey experiments \citep{friesen_sensory_2001, karbowski_systems_2008} and it is unclear to what extend those findings apply to \textit{C. elegans}. Open questions included: Where are the oscillations that drive undulatory motion generated? Are the undulatory waves propagated through neurons or muscles? To what extent is  feedback from the animal's environment required for locomotion? 

Chapters \ref{chapter:colbert} and \ref{chapter:proprioceptive} provide answers to some of these questions, and place strong experimental constrains on future models for \textit{C. elegans} locomotion.  Chapter \ref{chapter:omegaTurn} takes these questions to an even higher level, and asks how does the worm's nervous system transitions between forward and backward locomotion. 





This was the main focus of my thesis work

\subsection{Other applications of computer-vision for molecular biophysics}
The techniques that I have developed  can be applied to a wide variety of non-behavioral problems. This thesis includes another example. In chapters (C elegans) I report primarily on the interesting science. In this application to DNA barcodes, I include rigorous details of the software algorithm and the mathematical underpinnings, which is illustrative to how I approach the computer vision problems in the remaining chapters. 

Chapters 1-3 focus on the scientific results and not the algorithms (those interested can see the software directly which is available )

Systems neuroscience is approaching  a critical juncture. Arguably for the first time, the tools are falling into place that will enable the  completely characterization of how  neural activity of an entire organism drives behavior. Not only  do the tools presented here all the direct observation of neural activity but also the ability perturb neural activity-- and both while simultaneously observing behavior. We now turn to the work itself.
