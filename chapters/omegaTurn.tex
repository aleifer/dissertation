\chapter{Neural activity of the Omega Turn}\label{chapter:omegaTurn}



\lettrine{R}{ecently, changes in the neural activity} of the  \textit{C. elegans}  motor circuit between  the worm's forward and reverse locomotion has been an area of intense study in laboratories around the world \citep{piggott_neural_2011, faumont_image-free_2011, kawano_imbalancing_2011, ben_arous_automated_2010}.
Three groups published work on this area in only the past few months \citep{piggott_neural_2011, faumont_image-free_2011, kawano_imbalancing_2011}. In the ongoing work presented here, we study the neural activity that underlies the omega turn, which also includes two such transitions between  forward and reverse locomotion. We confirm some of the results found by others,  clarify certain ambiguities in the literature and use our rich and detailed behavioral readout to probe more deeply at correlations between  neural activity and specific subtle behaviors critical for navigation.


\section{Motivation}

Navigation is a goal directed locomotion, common across species, in which an organism moves toward or away from a cue.  At the neuronal level, navigation requires the temporal coordination of different motor programs.  How does an animal's nervous system orchestrate the changes in locomotion required for navigation? The \textit{Caenorhabditis elegans} escape response provides a platform upon which to investigate how navigation is carried out by a simple nervous system.  

Navigation in  \textit{C. elegans} is regulated by ventrally or dorsally biased head swings \citep{iino_parallel_2009} and deep ventral omega turns that reorient the worm in the opposite direction.  When the worm is touched on its anterior, it exhibits an escape response by pausing, reversing and turning ventrally in what is often called an omega turn.  The neural circuit for this escape response employs cells at all levels of the nervous system: mechanosensory neurons, command neurons, motor neurons, and muscle. The circuit plays an important role in the animal's decision making, the coordination of its motor programs and its turning behavior. 
The analysis of this stereotyped omega turn provides an opportunity to identify the  neuronal mechanisms that the nervous system employs to translate sensory information into navigational behavior.  


In this chapter we present ongoing work to explore the neural activity underlying the omega turn. A real-time tracking system was developed to record intracellular calcium transients in single neurons while simultaneously monitoring the macroscopic behavior of a freely moving worm as it undergoes an escape response.

[CHECK THE RIM DATA] Importantly, this work lays to rest some confusion in the field about the contribution of the neuron RIM to the escape response.  [TRUE?]

 
\section{Dual-Magnification Calcium and Behavior Imaging}
\subsection{Background}
To study the neural activity of an omega turn requires a system that permits simultaneous observation of neural activity and behavior in freely moving worms.  In particular, it is important to be able to correlate individual neural activity to rich details of the worm's behavior, such as changes in curvature or direction.


Genetically encoded fluorescent calcium indicators such as Cameleon \citep{miyawaki_fluorescent_1997} and GCaMP \citep{tian_imaging_2009} are the primary tools available for optical neurophysiology in \textit{C. elegans}.  The fluorescence of these indicators change with the level of intracellular calcium present. Calcium is often a good indicator of neural activity. As a result, the fluorescent levels can be monitored and neural activity can be inferred.

Calcium imaging is often performed at high magnification (20x or more)  to resolve individual neurons and with high numerical aperture (NA) objectives to collect large numbers of photons. As a result, calcium imaging had traditionally been  performed on immobilized  \citep{clark_afd_2006} or partially restrained animals  \citep{faumont_awake_2006}, where it is possible to keep the neurons of interest in a small field of view for an extended period of time. 

The Samuel Lab pioneered the first system to perform calcium imaging in a moving worm \citep{clark_temporal_2007}. In that system, the user manually adjusted a joystick to track the neuron AFD in the head of an unrestrained worm on a motorized stage. The worm was imaged with a high NA 20x objective. This system allowed the user to observe calcium transients in a worm as it moved. Because the field of view only included a small portion of the worm,  details of the worm's behavior like its curvature were not visible.  Additionally, manual tracking made it difficult to consistently track abrupt changes in the worm's  motion.

Since then, a number of groups have developed manual \citep{kawano_imbalancing_2011} and automated \citep{faumont_image-free_2011, ben_arous_automated_2010, piggott_neural_2011} tracking systems for calcium imaging in moving worms, using either home built \citep{ben_arous_automated_2010, piggott_neural_2011,kawano_imbalancing_2011} or commercial \citep{faumont_image-free_2011} systems. These systems vary in the feedback rate, complexity, cost and in their ability to capture behavior data. For example, the systems presented in \citep{piggott_neural_2011} and  \citep{kawano_imbalancing_2011} lack the ability to view the entire worm in the field of view. 


We have a developed a new tracking system that offers unique advantages. The system is built around a spinning disk confocal microscope which cuts down on background fluorescence and increases signal to noise. The system identifies target neurons from the worm's outline, rather than from their fluorescence which makes it well suited for transgenic animals that exhibit fluorescence in more then one neuron. Additionally, the system builds on our previous experience developing rich behavioral monitors and thus provides high spatiotemporal behavioral data at 30 Hz including the worm's instantaneous curvature and orientation.  


\subsection{The DualMag System}

\begin{figure} %Schematic of DualMag
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/omegaCalciumImagingSetup}
\caption[DualMag system apparatus.]{Schematic of the DualMag setup, permitting simultaneous recording of intracellular calcium transients and behavior in freely moving \textit{C. elegans}.  A transgenic worm, expressing GCaMP3 and mCherry in targeted neurons, crawls freely on a motorized stage under infrared illumination. An inexpensive USB camera images the worm's motion at low magnification. Real-time computer vision software rapidly analyzes each low magnification image and identifies the location and orientation of the worm and the targeted neuron and adjust the stage to keep the targeted neuron centered beneath a 20x objective used for calcium imaging.  Blue and yellow laser light shine through the 20x objective to excite GCaMp3 and mCherry in the targeted neuron. The emitted green and red fluorescence  is imaged through a spinning-disk confocal microscope onto two halves of an electron multiplying CCD camera.  Comparing the fluorescence in the green and red  channel images gives the relative level of calcium in the neuron. Slanted dashed lines indicate dichroic mirrors. \label{fig:omegaSchematic}}
\end{figure}



A tracking microscope was built capable of recording calcium transients in a moving worm. The microscope operates at two magnification levels simultaneously, one beam path operates at high-magnification to resolve single neurons, while the other beam path operates at low  magnification to view the entire body of the worm. Real-time computer vision software monitors the position of the body of the worm from the low-magnification beam path and adjusts a motorized stage to keep targeted neurons in the high-magnification field of view. The entire system is called the DualMag.


The DualMag system is built around an upright microscope body with a spinning disk confocal unit, a motorized stage and an additional low magnification imaging path. See Figure~\ref{fig:omegaSchematic} and Section \label{sec:omegaOptics} for details.

A transgenic animal  expressing GCaMP3 and mCherry in targeted neurons crawls freely on agar in a petri dish on a motorized stage under dark field infrared illumination. The high magnification beam path illuminates targeted neurons with  blue (445 nm) and yellow (561 nm) laser light though the spinning-disk confocal system, emitting fluorescence from GCaMP3 in the green and from mCherry in the red. Dichroic mirrors filter out the excitation light and pass only the emitted light to a DualView unit which projects the red and green channels side-by-side onto the sensor of an  EMCCD camera. See Figure \ref{fig:omegaSampleImages}c and Section \label{sec:omegaOptics}. 


\begin{figure}  %Sample Images of AVB

Red channel (right) shows calcium-independent mCherry fluorescence. Scale bar is 100 \textmu m.
\label{fig:omegaSampleImages}}
\end{figure}

A second beam path, beneath the microscope images the infrared light scattered by the worm at low magnification. An inexpensive USB CCD camera monitors the worm's position and orientation at 30 fps. See Figure \ref{fig:omegaSampleImages}a. Custom real-time computer vision software written in C identifies the worm's outline, its head and tail,  and the location of targeted neurons (Figure \ref{fig:omegaSampleImages}b and Section \label{sec:omegaSoftware}) and instructs the motorized stage to adjust its stage velocity to compensate for the worm's motion and to keep the targeted neuron squarely in the center of the high-magnification field of view. The feedback loop operates at 30 Hz and is sufficient to compensate for the worm's natural movements. See Figures \ref{fig:omegaTimeLapse} and \ref{fig:omegaMontage}.


\begin{figure}  %Time Lapse Image
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/omegaTimeLapse}
\caption[Time lapse image of behavior from low magnification beam path.]{Time-lapse stroboscopic darkfield image of worm behavior from the low magnification beam path is shown. The DualMag system continually adjusts the stage's velocity to isolate motion in a region of the worm's head. A 28 ms exposure image was taken every 3 seconds for 1 minute. Scale bar is 1 mm.
\label{fig:omegaTimeLapse}}
\end{figure}


While similar in principal to prior work \citep{ben_arous_automated_2010, piggott_neural_2011} this is the first system, to our knowledge, that uses a  spinning disk confocal microscope which cuts down on background fluorescence. Second, it uses an inexpensive USB camera to do the tracking and  leverages the real-time computer vision software from the CoLBeRT system \citep{leifer_optogenetic_2011} to perform rapid feedback based on the worm's morphology, not individual neuron fluorescence.

\section{Neural Activity of the Escape Response}
The escape response in \textit{C. elegans} can be elicited by gently touching the anterior of the worm or by vibration. The response is  stereotyped: The worm first ceases its forward locomotion and exploratory head movements \citep{alkema_tyramine_2005}, it then moves backward away from the stimulus \citep{chalfie_neural_1985}, comes to a stop, and then bends its head ventrally to execute a deep ventral turn before finally reinitiating forward locomotion.  See Figure \ref{fig:omegaMontage}. The entire sequence is commonly referred to as an omega turn. 

\begin{figure}  %Montage of an Omega Turn
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/omegaMontage}
\caption[Video of worm escape response.]{Video of worm escape response is shown. The worm undergoes forward locomotion.  At 0 s, an electric toothbrush vibrates the worm's petri dish and the worm halts forward locomotion and begins a reversal. At 2.7 s the worm ceases reversing and begins a deep ventral bend. At 4.3 s the worm exhibits the omega shape that gives the omega turn its name. At 5.4 s the worm recommences forward locomotion. Scale bar is 100 \textmu m.
\label{fig:omegaMontage}}
\end{figure}



 The escape response is initiated by mechanosensory neurons which transduce sensory information through locomotion command neurons to excitatory and inhibitory motor neurons that innervate the body wall muscles \citep{chalfie_neural_1985}. Laser ablation and genetic studies have  elucidated which neurons are required for which behavior \citep{chalfie_neural_1985, zheng_neuronal_1999, alkema_tyramine_2005}. A wiring diagram representing current thinking in the field is summarized in Figure \ref{fig:omegaCircuitDiagram}. Despite a rich literature describing which neurons are required for which behavior, it is only very recently that researchers have begun to study how neural activity correlates to behavior, and even then only in regards to forward versus backward locomotion \citep{piggott_neural_2011, faumont_image-free_2011, kawano_imbalancing_2011, ben_arous_automated_2010}. To fully understand the nervous system, one must also investigate the dynamics of neural activity and investigate the precise patterns and sequences of neural activity that drive behavior. As a first part of this ongoing work, the pattern of neural activity in the neurons AVA, AVB and RIM investigated and correlated to the precise pattern of behavior exhibited by the worm during an omega turn.

\section{Methods}

\subsection{Strains}
The \textit{C. elegans} strains used include QW280: \textit{zfIs12[Prig-3::ChR2::GFP, lin-15(+)]}
, QW625: \textit{zfIs42[Prig-3::GCaMP3::SL2::mCherry; lin-15(+)]}, QW663: \textit{lin-15(n765ts); zfEx219[Pcex-1::GCaMP3::SL2::mCherry; lin-15(+)]}, QW666: \textit{lin-15(n765ts);
zfEx222[Plgc-55::mCherry::SL2::GCaMP3; lin-15(+)]}. Transgenic strains were
generated by microinjection of plasmid DNA along with the \textit{lin-15} rescuing construct
pL15EK into the germline of \textit{lin-15(n765ts)} mutants. ChR2, GCaMP3 and \textit{lin-
15(+)} plasmids were injected at 100 ng/\textmu l, 50 ng/\textmu l and 80 ng/\textmu l respectively.
Extrachromosomal arrays were integrated into the genome by X-ray irradiation (120kV)
for 10 minutes. Integrated strains were outcrossed four times to N2 wild type.

\subsection{Calcium Imaging in Moving Worm}
\subsubsection{Optics}\label{sec:omegaOptics}

Blue (445 nm) and yellow (561 nm) lasers are fiber-coupled into the spinning disk system. Using a 20x objective with a field of view  about 300 \textmu m wide, each laser  provides a maximum power output of 20mW/mm$^2$. An Andor Ion BLAH BLAH BLAH camera images fluorescence at 20Hz with an exposure time of 50ms. 

The condensor lens was removed from the bottom of the microscope to make room for a second low-magnifcation beam path. A an IR prism mirror reflects infrared light into an optical train composed of a telescope and a long pass filter.  

In the experiments described here, the blue laser was run at 3 mW/mm$^2$ and the yellow laser was run at 10 mW/mm$^2$ to avoid pohotobleaching.

\subsubsection{Real-Time Tracking} \label{sec:omegaSoftware}
MAC 6000 [ANDY GRAB ALL OF THIS FROM THE COLBERT SYSTEM] connected over USB, running Windows XP. 
Imaging Source Camera [ANDY Look it up.]
Modified version of the MindControl software, written in C using OpenCV open source computer vision library with hardware optimized Intel Integrated Performance Primitives [ANDY cite other chapter]. 

In brief:
Identifies the outline of the worm, finds the head tail, segments the worm into coordinates, then identifies the targeted neuron within the coordinate system. Finally, the software measures the distance of the targeted neuron from the center of the high magnification field of view and adjusts the stage velocity to glide the worm back towards the center. 

[ANDY CLEAN UP HERE]


The software is essentially the same as in [CITE BEFORE] with the following minor modifications, which were necessary to address poor lighting and the demands for more rapid tracking: When identifying the outline of the worm the software now performs a dilation on the image [CITE LEARNING OPENCV] which can compensate for ``holes'' that appear in the worm due to imaging through the agar plate. The newer version also allows the the outline of the worm to be smoothed directly, wheras the old version only allowed the underlying image to be smoothed. Finally the new version of the software provides finer control of the stage response to the feedback loop. 




\subsubsection{Video Synchronization}
The DualMag system records two independent video streams recorded at different frame rates on different computers. The two video streams are synchronized by shining synchronous pulses of LED light at the appropriate wavelength into both cameras. LEDs are controlled independently from the other software mentioned by a custom LabView program  interfaced with a LabJack digital to analog converter. [BLAH BLAH BLAH. ANDY Find LABJACK] The flashes of light are identified manually offline during post processing. 

\subsubsection{Video Analysis}

\begin{comment}

I will express the fluorescent calcium sensor, GCaMP3 (Tian et al., 2009), in the AVM and ALM mechanosensory neurons, the AVA and AVB locomotion command neurons; the RMD, SMD and RIV neck motor neurons; and muscles with the mec-4, rig-3, lgc-55, lim-4 and myo-3 promoters (Sagasti et al., 1999; Pirri et al., 2009; Brockie et al., 2001; Ardizzi and Epstein, 1987).  With these transgenic lines, I will analyze mechanosensory neuron, command neuron, motor neuron and neck muscle flourescence to determine their activity during turning behavior.
