This thesis would not have been possible without the support of many individuals throughout my graduate studies. Thanks first and foremost to my advisor Aravinthan Samuel. Aravi took me into his laboratory as a refugee from another lab. I could not have asked for a more supportive advisor. 

Aravi provided me intellectual freedom and wonderful environment to explore and build.

Taught me the importance of being a respectful and humble colleague and collaborator. 





Thanks to my parents Anne and Mark for their encouragmenet. To Professor Jim Hogle and Michele Jakoulov of the Program in Biophysics at Harvard.
