*** An introduction ***

The HarvardThesis package provides all of files needed to support the production and typesetting of a PhD thesis at Harvard.

****Installation***

This is the setup that Andrew uses on Windows and Mac:

For Windows XP:
================ 
Download basic-miktex-2.9.4244.exe  http://miktex.org/
Download SumatraPDF v 1.5.1 http://blog.kowalczyk.info/software/sumatrapdf/free-pdf-reader.html
Download this Git Repo 

Installatioan instructions:
Copy the contents of fonts\ into 
C:\Program Files\MiKTeX 2.9\fonts\opentype\public\ChaparralPro


To complie, from the MSYS command prompt run: 
xelatex -synctex=-1 thesis.tex


For Mac OS X
==============
Downlaod MacTex (when I tried, the main site was down so I used this mirror)
http://mirror.unl.edu/ctan/systems/mac/mactex/MacTeX.mpkg.zip  
it should be roughly 2 GB
Install.

I use the free PDF reader Skim and the non-free editor TextMate. Both integrate well with latex:

Skim is available http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/
Set Skim->Preferences->Sync to the Preset "TextMate." You can command-shift-click in the PDF to pull up a line in the code in Textmate.

Now to setup TextMate, go to the Bundle->LaTex->Preferences and choose xelatex and Skim respectively.
Then go to Bundles->Latex-> File Preferences -> Set Master file and select your master file.. thesis.tex


To compile, from the terminal run:
xelatex  thesis


I also use Zotero http://www.zotero.org/ with the following modification to enable drag and drop cite keys:
